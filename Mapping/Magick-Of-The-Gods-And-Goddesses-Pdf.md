The Greco-Roman philosophical and literary traditions give the impression that women were the adepts of love and erotic magic. These reflect patriarchal male fears of women disrupting the normal and rightful hierarchies that preserved order.

Epigraphical, archaeological and papyrological evidence, such as spells of the Greek (PGM) and Demotic magical papyri (PDM) and the defixiones, or curse tablets and binding spells, demonstrate that men performed erotic magic as much, possibly even more than women.
 
All the gods are capable of magic and can grant requests. Still, erotic magic is associated with three different groups of gods: Aphrodite and her entourage, Selene and Helios, and gods related to the Underworld such as Hekate, Hermes, and Persephone, as well as daemons and restless spirits.

Galanthis was a friend of Alcmene who assisted her during the birth of Heracles. As a favour to Hera, the Moirae (Fates) and Eileithyia (goddess of childbirth) kept Alcmene in continuous birth pangs. Galanthis told them that Alcmene had given birth. The goddesses released their hold on Alcmene, and she gave birth to Heracles. Enraged by the deception, the Moirae punished Galanthis by transforming her into a polecat. Hekate felt sorry for Galanthis and appointed her as one of her sacred servants.
 
Writing for The Freque, the online magazine of the crystal sex toy store, Chakrubs (how good is that name?), Gabriela Herstik, an author and priestess of Venus, recommends the Viper (NSFW) for sex magick involving Hekate.
 
Learned Pagans are familiar with the intersections of sex and magick, at least in theory. In Sacred Kink, you find connections between religion/spirituality and BDSM in creating stories, worlds, meanings, and the ritual exploration of boundaries, including the transgression of social norms.
 
Hekate is a virgin goddess. That is, she never married and had no regular consort. In some traditions, she has children, but she may have had them using parthenogenesis (without sexual intercourse). Even if Hekate abstained from sex (or was asexual), she is not offended by sex.
 
It is generally believed that the cult of Luna dates back to the time of the Kings i.e. predates Republican Rome. The mythical story of Romulus and Remus culminating in the foundation of Rome in 753BC is well known. The city was subsequently ruled by a series of seven kings, not all of whom were as competent as Romulus, the first King of Rome. Eventually, deposition of the seventh king, Tarquinius Superbus, led to the advent of the Roman Republic in 509BC. When the first (mythical) war between Rome/Romulus and the Sabines/Titus Tatius came to an end the two leaders agreed to form a complete Roman society; each pledged to fulfil his religious duty by institution of cults. Romulus instituted a single cult - to Jupiter - and Titus Tatius introduced a series of cults including those to Sol and Luna.
 
Roman goddesses of the moon, and their Greek counterparts, were said to be formed in a triadic manner hence Luna was associated with two further goddesses, Diana and Hecate. Luna was the goddess in heaven and of the full moon (Greek counterpart being Selene), Diana was the goddess on earth and of the halfmoon (Greek Artemis) and Hecate (or Hekate) was the goddess in the underworld and of the dark moon.
 
Diana was originally a goddess of fertility and was worshipped by women as the giver of fertility and easy births. She was also the goddess of nature and of hunting. Hecate was the underworld goddess of magic and witchcraft. Varro mentions the association of Luna with Diana and further association with other goddesses linked to chastity and childbirth such as Prosperina and Juno Lucina, an ancient maternal character. The latter may even have been a more central figure within the triad of moon goddesses with Hecate being a later participant.
 
The multiple facets of women, femininity and childbirth were believed to be associated with the phases of the moon: the new moon represented the maiden goddess, Diana, always new, virginal, reborn and ready for the hunt whereas the waxing moon increasing in size represented the fertile mother goddess, pregnant with life. The darkening moon reflected the wise crone or witch, Hecate, with power to heal and transform.
 
A temple dedicated to Luna dating from the 6th century BC and attributed to Servius Tullius, the legendary sixth King of Rome who reigned from 578BC to 535BC, stood on the Aventine Hill in Rome. According to Livy (Roman historian 64/59BC - AD12/17), the temple was damaged during a storm in 182BC with the doors being torn off and blown into the rear wall of the nearby temple of Ceres (an ancient goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships hence strongly associated with Luna). Following the Achaean war in 146BC, the consul Lucius Mummius deposited some of the spoils gained during the sack of Corinth (a city in south-central Greece) in the temple of Luna. Another famous politician linked to the temple is Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, the reformist tribune of 123/122BC who is said to have been injured jumping down from the temple when fleeing from his enemies. The temple sustained further damage in 84BC following a lightning strike; that this led to postponement of the consular elections confirms the importance of the cult of Luna in Republican Rome. Likely situated at the northern end of the Aventine near the Porta Trigomina the temple is said to have been destroyed during the great fire of Rome in 64AD during the reign of the Emperor Nero. Varro attests to a second temple, on the Palatine Hill, which was illuminated at night and dedicated to Luna Noctiluca (night-shiner/Luna that shines by night).
 
Evidence that Luna was a visible deity outside Rome itself comes from an analysis of pipe-clay figurines recovered from Roman London. 168 such artefacts have been discovered within the Londinium settlement from a mix of residential, trade and religious sites. The figurines were modelled using two piece moulds by plastes, craftsmen, working from officinae, terracotta production centres in the Allier Valley in France. Sixty four percent (109) of the 168 figurines were deities; all were female and Venus was by far the most common (85) however there were two Luna/Diana figurines and one Juno. The Luna/Diana figurines were found below modern day Leadenhall Street and Bond Court - they are unique as only one other similar figurine, from a cemetary near Nijmegan in The Netherlands has been recorded.
 
Roman belief that gods and goddesses controlled every aspect of life resulted in countless deities presiding over every task, every occupation, every action. Each deity had to be wooed with prayers, vows, dedication of altars, animal or bird sacrifices and offerings of milk, honey, grain, fruit, cake, perfumes or flowers. Animal and bird sacrifices were specified by colour and gender hence sacrifices to Luna, conducted outside her temple on the Aventine Hill, would have been of white animals or birds.
 
Glorification of the gods, proper management of relations with the gods and ethical behaviour were cornerstones of Roman society and led to Roman prosperity and Roman dominance. It was within this societal framework that the cult of Luna flourished.

Ancient Egyptian art comes in many forms and covers more than a thousand years. Despite this wide variety, most Egyptian art sought to convey their view of the world, including their views about life and death. 
 Due to this, much of their art contains religious subject matter, and all of their art is highly symbolic. This can be seen in their depictions of Isis and Nut, two of the most important Egyptian Goddesses.
 
Isis was the Egyptian Goddess of Magic. She was originally associated with the throne of Egypt, which contained magical power because it could turn a prince into a king. 
 Later, Isis "absorbed the attributes of most other goddesses and some gods and became a supreme deity, famous for her curing and redemptive powers"*(Lesko, 155)*. 
 She was the sister and wife of Osiris, and after his death, she became the protector of the dead. In her love and devotion to Osiris, Isis became a symbol of the
 loving wife while after his death she became a symbol of the Mother in her protection and her devotion to her son, Horus *(Hallam 156)*.
 

 In the first image, the wings, the headdress, the colors used, and the gestures depicted all have symbolic meaning. The wings of Isis symbolize either female falcons or kites, which are birds of prey that have cries "reminiscent of the cries of distraught women" *(Lesko 163)*. In this way, the wings represent both power and mourning. They also represent the resurrective power of Isis, who fans her wings to give breath back to her dead husband, Osiris *(Baring & Cashford 231)*. This is at times reinforced by the green color of the wings because green symbolizes both life and resurrection in Egyptian art *(Wilkinson 108)*. The wings also symbolize safety because they are depicted as outspread, which is a protective gesture in Egyptian art *(Freed 22)*. In this way, the wings of Isis reveal her magical ability (resurrective power), her grief, and her protection of the dead.
 
Her headdress is the Egyptian hieroglyph for the throne,
