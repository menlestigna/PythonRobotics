A pulse wave is the change in the volume of a blood vessel that occurs when the heart pumps blood, and a detector that monitors this volume change is called a pulse sensor.
First, there are four main ways to measure heart rate: electrocardiogram, photoelectric pulse wave, blood pressure measurement, and phonocardiography.
Pulse sensors use the photoelectric method.
 
Pulse sensors using the photoelectric pulse wave method are classified into 2 types depending on the measurement method: transmission and reflection.
Transmission types measure pulse waves by emitting red or infrared light from the body surface and detecting the change in blood flow during heart beats as a change in the amount of light transmitted through the body.
This method is limited to areas where light can easily penetrate, such as the fingertip or earlobe.
ROHM is currently developing a reflection-type pulse sensor (Optical Sensor for Heart Rate Monitor).
The reflection-type pulse sensor (Optical Sensor for Heart Rate Monitor) is explained below.

Pulse wave measurement using red or infrared light can be affected by infrared rays contained in sunlight (i.e. outdoors), preventing stable operation. For this reason, usage indoors or semi-indoors is recommended.
For pulse wave measurement outdoors (i.e. by smart watches), a green light source which has a high absorption rate in hemoglobin and less susceptibility to ambient light is preferred, so ROHM utilizes green LEDs as transmission light sources.
 
Generally, by looking at the period of fluctuation from the waveform obtained by measurements of the pulse wave sensor and observing the pulsation (variation) using the heart rate along with both red and infrared waves, it is possible to measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).
In addition, using data from pulse sensors is expected to enable calculation of various vital signs such as HRV analysis (stress level) and vascular age through high-speed sampling and high accuracy measurement.
 
Heart rate data can be really useful whether you're designing an exercise routine, studying your activity or anxiety levels or just want your shirt to blink with your heart beat. The problem is that heart rate can be difficult to measure. Luckily, the Pulse Sensor Amped can solve that problem!
 
The Pulse Sensor Amped is a plug-and-play heart-rate sensor for Arduino. It can be used by students, artists, athletes, makers, and game & mobile developers who want to easily incorporate live heart-rate data into their projects.It essentially combines a simple optical heart rate sensor with amplification and noise cancellation circuitry making it fast and easy to get reliable pulse readings. Also, it sips power with just 4mA current draw at 5V so it's great for mobile applications.
 
Simply clip the Pulse Sensor to your earlobe or finger tip and plug it into your 3 \*or \*5 Volt Arduino and you're ready to read heart rate! The 24" cable on the Pulse Sensor is terminated with standard male headers so there's no soldering required. Of course Arduino example code is available as well as a Processing sketch for visualizing heart rate data.
 
I've been testing these out, and it appears that the power consumption is much higher than advertised. It says in the description that it draws 4mA @ 5V, however I am consuming 15mA @5V, 13-14mA @3.3V, which is much higher than expected. The sensor is worn during this, so I don't think it's from amplifier saturation. This happens consistently for long periods of time, so I don't think it's a fluke, and I just tested it on a brand-new, freshly set up sensor, so I don't think it's the sensor itself.Is there something I'm doing wrong, or is this normal? This is for a battery-powered application, so it's important that it is as low power as possible.
 
Hi, I already bought this sensor and trying to do the connection with servo by bluetooth (slave-master) which really worked for my prototype but my servo (tower pro-SG90) which is so loud and I guess not enough to imitate the heart beat. Can I ask you which kind of servo are you using in heart shape? If you have can you send a link of the servo you are using?

Great product, but is there any sense of why the cost? This is an ADC and an amp after all. I noticed on the mfg. site they have a photo of the makershed store listing it for $20, but when you click through to the product page it's $25. I've never complained about Sparkfun's pricing, but doesn't this seem excessive for this board?!
 
I usually think that Sparkfun prices things very appropriately, especially their breakout boards. However, I must agree with you that this is rather overpriced. If this had even an ATTiny to serialize the output, or any "Active" component, I would accept the price. With this simple a circuit, I have to say that the cost outweighs the features.
 
Quite true, sorry, I suppose was thinking of a more complex device, something to actually average the output, a small micro or something, or perhaps even a well-tuned low-pass filter for noise suppression, but you are correct, an Op-amp is considered an active component. A 19 cent op-amp and an 88 cent light sensor still does not justify the $20 price tag, in my opinion.
 
The current link points to old code (1dot1) and the latest example sketch (1dot4) is MUCH better at providing a solid pulse signal. I just re-wrote my negative review into a positive one after I tried the latest example source, it was like night and day in terms of how well it picks up my pulse. With the old example I had to get my finger on there JUST right, now it's much more forgiving and doesn't send out a bunch of junk pulses unless there's a solid consistent signal.
 
This is an absolutely unacceptably horrible product! I have never been so fully disappointed in the entirety of my life. Sadly, I have received absolutely NO help whatsoever from SparkFun's technical support, and therefore the product is rendered useless. It broke within hours of opening the package and never worked once. Don't buy this product. PERIOD.
 
I Must say i have to agree with you Ami ! what a waste of good money! sesnor doesnt work the demo code doesnt work , and when you go to supplier website pulsesensor.com geuss what there is no " contact us" details you are left to post in the forum to which no one responds
 
Does anyone know if the example code here can be used with the fastLED library? I've got the fastLED library set up on my micro (same as leonardo) to run the WS2801 addressable LED strips and I'd love to have a heart rate sensor to control colors or fading.
 
Processing: The Pulse Sensor comes with code for on screen processing. This processing runs on a computer that is communicating serially to the Arduino processor that is getting analog input from the pulse sensor as input.Processing:To listen in on what the Arduino sketch is sending, Processing is used and comes with a Serial library designed for it.
 
To create a font to use with Processing, select "Create Font..." from the Tools menu. This will create a font in the format Processing requires and also adds it to the current sketch's data directory.
 
You would need something to power the device, but other than that it looks like it's an analog output device so you theoretically could hook it up to a microphone jack with appropriate circuitry. Given the need for power and the greater flexibility, though, I'd stick to a microcontroller-based approach.
 
Hi people! I just got myself few of those sensors. I discovered that when attached to the body (finger or a bit above the wrist) when I move a bit there are massive disturbances in the signal, any suggestions? How it is when it is attached to the ear? Is it also so sensible to movement?Do you know some other sensor that is not disturbed by movement and gives reliable signal?Thanks
 
This is junk. I bought 3 of these and could never get them to work. The Arduino code does not even work on stock UNO. Their website is totally bogus and just spits ads at you. Other people on their forum complained that the device did not work but nobody ever replied with a fix or even a comment. To add insult to injury if you decide to post on the forum you have to endure listening to some useless 12 second ad (Progressive insurance !) so you can get the capcha code to submit the comment. What a joke ? A support forum is there to support users not to generate revenue for the site. Complete waste of $ 75.
 
I need a heart rate monitoring hardware. Is this sensor stable and accurate? Can i trust its result? I was planning the buy an ECG sensor from cooking-hacks. Can anyone help me?And can i use this sensor with raspberry pi?
 
I think that the sensor that I received was defective. I tried running the example Arduino code, using several different Arduino boards, placing the sensor at different locations on my skin, and the measured heart rate fluctuated between 2 and 3 times the actual value (measured from another device).
 
I have a dog, and I have tried, but he shakes it off his head and then tests it's flavor!You will really need to test various anatomy of rodents. Works best with capillary tissues. My first thought would be to select a part of the anatomy that wouldn't contribute much movement noise, then shave the area, and attach the sensor with a double-stick tape. Crazy! Might work.Ear is possibility, but the ear membrane is rather thin. Worth testing... and easy to test, with the Pulse Sensor!btw, i am part owner of Pulse Sensor
 
I was wondering if there was an alternative to using HOT GLUE to protect the "back" of the sensor?A week ago I purchased a sensor and it worked great. Until I put the recommended hot glue on it.Since then it stopped working. I attempted to remove the wad of hardened hot glue and some of it remained embedded.(a
