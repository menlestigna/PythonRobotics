Germany has a rich culture. For centuries it was the land of many intellectual people and the greatest events. They influenced and shaped not just the culture of the old continent of Europe, but the culture of the whole globe. Their traces are all over the place and history.
 
Octoberfest, the greatest event of their favorite drink, the beer, is one of the many events that are held in Germany. Berlin Film Festival brings together film and art celebrities from all over the world.

Germans are very good at the construction and automotive industries, making them one of the toughest competitors worldwide in these fields. Their impact and presence in historical architecture are all over Europe (Romanesque buildings, Gothics, Classicists, Baroque, Rococos and Renascences). Mostly there are old castles and religious objects. The tallest church in Germany is the Cathedral of Ulm 161.53 meters high.
 
The homeland of many famous intellectual people who left their mark in history, that they gave to the world, are people like Einstein and Mozart. Germany is known as Das Land der Dichter und Denker (the country of poets and thinkers).
 
***Leberkse***  
Here is the other dish made with pork meat. Leberkse is served in little pieces with bread and mustard rather than a real meal. It is a sausage but in contrast with other German sausages, it is kept in the oven for a long time.
 
You thought Gulasch originated from elsewhere. Well, you were correct. But, Germans have their own variation. German Gulasch is made of a sliced piece of meat combined with a rich sauce and sometimes with some wine which makes it softer and tender.

Our small, interactive, project-oriented courses encourage students to develop their analytical and critical thinking skills, their transcultural competence, and their interpersonal and communicative skills. Working with authentic materials from German-speaking countries students gain linguistic competence and deepen awareness of their own and other cultures. Interdisciplinary approaches allow students to engage in intellectually challenging group and individual projects and to achieve high levels of language competence as articulated in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEF). The adaptation of this Framework to German Studies curriculum equips our students to succeed as global citizens.
 
The Cornell University German Studies Undergraduate Program is unique in adapting the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEF) to reflect the needs and qualities of Cornell students. Accordingly, curriculum development integrates research in second language acquisition and cognitive learning theories into a well-articulated sequence of language study. This allows for setting clear standards to be attained at each level of instruction while accommodating varying learner styles and encouraging student autonomy. Our re-conceptualized program enables students to attain high levels of language competence and equips them to become successful participants in a transnational community.

At age ten, I watched as my older brother went on his first exchange venture to Europe. From that moment, I decided I would also go abroad. But even then, upon mentioning my dream, I encountered obstacles. The adults around me focused on the difficulties that a girl with low vision would have on her own in a foreign land, and they could not conceive of a plan to prepare for the perceived problems. But, I continued to learn the German language and study the culture. After my freshmen year of college, I just went for it.
 
The trains in Berlin announce over the loudspeaker each station before they stop, a feature I found very helpful. Still exhausted from the flight to Germany and time zone changes, on my third day in Germany, I dozed off on a train in Berlin just for a moment. It was a moment too long.
 
I asked a German woman at the station for directions to Lichtenberg. My speaking skills were not well practiced and I was nervous. My guide dog also sensed my worry; I walk fast, but I walk even faster when I do not know where I am going.
 
I went to Germany to improve my German language skills. I studied in an international language school in downtown Berlin where my classes included foreign students from all over Europe. Together we visited castles and museums, and walked around Berlin enjoying the architecture and food.
 
During my four-week study abroad program, I became accustomed to some people not recognizing my guide dog, Cammy, as a service animal. My German host father, whose sister also has a guide dog, argued with a shopkeeper for several minutes before my guide dog was allowed in the store. While Germany has a law for service dog access, it is not well known.
 
When my friend and I visited the Cecielinhof museum, I learned that though the familiarity with service animals in Germany is not as common as in the United States, we could still gain access to interesting sites.
 
I gained much more access to understanding the culture than just touching typically off-limits museum pieces. This cross-cultural experience connected me to the history of Germany and my family. When I return to Germany next, I will not feel the stress of schoolwork or u
