Philips car radios will normally contain a 14 digit serial number which can be found either printed on a label or engraved on the side of the unit.

These serials are only visible once the Philips radio has been removed from the vehicle.

Examples of serials include:
 
By using our online Philips radio decoding service, you not only save yourself money, but also time and the additional hassle involved.Most vehicle main dealers will require you to book an appointment and take the car and paperwork (v5 logbook) into them before they apply for the radio code. Once they do apply for the code, 9/10 times it will be based on the vehicle registration or VIN number of the car itself, which is fine if you have owned the car from new. However, receiving the radio code days later only to find that it did not work is yet another inconvenience.

There are a number of reasons why a radio code based on the vehicle registration or vin number may not work, including:
 

At Radio-Code, we don't provide radio codes based on the car, instead we provide the code based on the individual and unique serial number of the car radio, regardless of what it was fitted to originally. Our radio codes have proven to be more accurate than main dealer's because of this.

 
Our company has created a generator of service codes for these devices. It is able to generate an appropriate service code based on the machine identifier to be used in **K2000 Visa Entry** software, which will create an appropriate file allowing access to the service menu.
 
We also offer a generator in the form of a **compiled application** and **source codes** in the C language. It can be reused many times or the key generation algorithm can be embedded in other software.

The company was founded in 1891 by Gerard Philips and his father Frederik, with their first products being light bulbs. Philips employs around 80,000 people across 100 countries.[2] The company gained its royal honorary title (hence the *Koninklijke*) in 1998 and dropped the "Electronics" in its name in 2013,[3] due to its refocusing on healthcare technology.
 
Philips is organized into three main divisions: Personal Health (formerly Philips Consumer Electronics and Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care), Connected Care, and Diagnosis & Treatment (formerly Philips Medical Systems).[4] The lighting division was spun off as a separate company, Signify N.V.
 
The company started making electric shavers in 1939 under the Philishave and Norelco brands, and post-war it developed the Compact Cassette, an audiotape format, and co-developed the compact disc format with Sony, as well as numerous other technologies. As of 2012,[update] Philips was the largest manufacturer of lighting in the world as measured by revenue.
 
Philips has a primary listing on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5] It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Acquisitions included Signetics and Magnavox. It also founded a multidisciplinary sports club called PSV Eindhoven in 1913.
 
The Philips Company was founded in 1891, by Dutch entrepreneur Gerard Philips and his father Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in Zaltbommel, financed the purchase and setup of an empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has since been adapted and is used as a museum.[6]
 
In 1895, after a difficult first few years and near-bankruptcy, the Philips's brought in Anton, Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years. Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips corporation, they laid the foundations for the later multinational.
 
On 11 March 1927, Philips went on the air, inaugurating the shortwave radio station PCJJ (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by a sister station (Philips Omroep Holland-Indi, later PHI). PHOHI broadcast in Dutch to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and later PHI broadcast in English and other languages to the Eastern hemisphere, while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.[*citation needed*]
 
The international program Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the *Happy Station* show, which became the world's longest-running shortwave program. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in Huizen to use for pro-Nazi broadcasts, some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.
 
Philips Radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch International Service. Some PCJ programs, such as *Happy Station*, continued on the new station.
 
Encouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16 W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of 30 mm 25 mm,[10] various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout World War II. By the late 1940s, the 'Type 10' was ready to be handed over to Philips' subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200 W electrical output from a bore and stroke of 55 mm 27 mm, was designated MP1002CA (known as the "Bungalow set"). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price, besides the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.[11]
 
In parallel with the generator set, Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the 'reversed Stirling engine' cryocooler. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.[12]
 
On 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German invasion of the Netherlands was to take place the following day. Having prepared for this, Anton Philips and his son-in-law Frans Otten, as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States, taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the **North American Philips Company**, they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the Netherlands Antilles to keep it out of German hands.[13]
 
On 6 December 1942, the British No. 2 Group RAF undertook Operation Oyster, which heavily damaged the Philips Radio factory in Eindhoven with few casualties among the Dutch workers and civilians.[14] The Philips works in Eindhoven was bombed again by the RAF on 30 March 1943.[15][16]
 
Frits Philips, the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands. He saved the lives of 382 Jews by convincing the Nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at Philips.[17] In 1943, he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at Vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production. For his actions in saving the hundreds of Jews, he was recognized by Yad Vashem in 1995 as a "Righteous Among the Nations".[18]
 
In 1954, Cor Dillen (of the very well known and prestigious Dillen family) (director and later CFO and also CEO) put Philips on the map in South America introducing them to Color television for the first time [21] in most countries of the Americas like Brazil, although Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s when Dillen was named the company's CEO.
 
Philips introduced the Compact Cassette audio tape format in 1963, and it was wildly successful. Cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing stenographers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside vinyl records used to sell recorded music.
 
Philips introduced the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the "radio recorder", and is now better known as the boom box. Later, the cassette was used in telephone answering machines, including a special form of cassette where the tape was
