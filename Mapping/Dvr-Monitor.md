It combinesthe features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon andRegmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich andnon-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such as sessionIDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stackswith integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous loggingto a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will makeProcess Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting andmalware hunting toolkit.
 
It becomes your perfect control room when you feel comfortable with the room's features and perception. With dearVR MONITOR, you quickly adapt the virtual mix room to your taste and needs using the AMBIENCE and the FOCUS parameter. Set the right amount of diffusion and, therefore, the vividness of the mix room with Ambience. Select the perfect level between overall coloration and localization based on the patented Clarity algorithm by Sennheiser AMBEO.

Stop spending hours double-checking how your mix translates into common listening scenarios. dearVR MONITOR puts you just a few clicks away from monitoring your production in 11 different acoustic environments like Club, Car, Cinema, Living Room, and many more.
 
Activate the built-in Headphone Compensation (SHC) and start making solid mixes with an accuracy that you won't find anywhere else. Compensating for the characteristics of individual headphone models, Dear Reality's SHC applies the optimal adjustments to support a model-independent accurate simulation of listening environments.
 
You can use dearVR MONITOR in most VST3/AU/AAX DAWs without any special hardware. To listen to multi-channel audio formats from 5.1 to 9.1.6, you just need a DAW that supports the same number of channels per track as the format you want to monitor.
 
In general, dearVR MONITOR works with any headphones brand. However, open-back headphones and in-ears with a flat frequency response work best.  
The built-in Spatial Headphone Compensation technology further enhances the reliability and spatial impression, supporting a model-independent accurate listening environment simulation. You can find a list of the supported models here.

dearVR MONITOR uses our advanced binaural filtering technology to provide you the impression of a natural acoustic environment with loudspeakers in front of and around you. Using this on stereo speakers could cause an intense coloration of the sound and is not recommended, although you can use the Focus slider to reduce the coloration.
 
dearVR MIX offers a perfect stereo control room. dearVR MONITOR extends this concept to an idealized multi-channel control room, supporting formats 5.1 up to 7.1.2 or 9.1.6. It also includes two more control rooms and five more listening environments.
 
2 USB-C connections for easy wired access to Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android devices. Simple connectivity via Miracast can handle up to 2 devices on 1 150BW portable monitor and can wirelessly multicast up to 5 150BW portable monitors at a time.

The Shodan platform helps you monitor not just your known network but also find your devices across the Internet. Detect data leaks to the cloud, phishing websites, compromised databases and more. Shodan gives you the tools to monitor all your connected devices on the Internet.
 
Tired of busy dashboards with too much unnecessary information? Shodan Monitor is designed to help you quickly hone in the most important issues. Take advantage of our years of experience crawling the Internet to provide context and filter out the noise.
 
Shodan Monitor supports everything from individual IPs up to tracking of events across the entire Internet. To see how many IPs or networks you're currently able to monitor please visit the **Shodan Developer dashboard.**
 
No, Shodan Monitor automatically and continuously crawls the network ranges that are being monitored. If you want to request an immediate scan then you can do that by visiting the Manage Networks page.
 
Yes, Shodan Monitor is built ontop of the existing Shodan API. Specifically, we are taking advantage of the Network Alerts stream which contains all events for your specified network range(s). See the official streaming documentation for the details: **Streaming API Documentation**
 
Since I updated to Windows 11 I've been having a weird issue. I'm not able to select a different wallpaper for each of my two monitors. In the Personalization>Background menu, upon right clicking on the image to display the context menu, if I select "Set for Desktop 2" it does not change anything. On the other hand if I select "Set for Desktop 1" it changes the background for both monitors. Please note that I have my dual monitor set to Extend and not duplicate.
 
Hover over the "desktop" app on the taskbar next to the magnifying glass. It should say "Desktop 1" & "New Desktop". Open a New Desktop and remove "Desktop 1". After I did this it worked for me. I hope it works for you too! :)
 
This fixed it for me. I went to windows 11 > Display Settings > disconnected all monitors but the main one, re-extended my 2nd monitor. Went into Display Settings > Personalization > Background > and then had the right-click option on a recent image to select monitor 1 or 2.
 
I had virtual desktops active. What I had to do was remove all the virtual desktops, then I was able to select the background for specific monitors using the right-click menu on Recent Images in Settings > Personalization > Background.
 
Of course, using this method, all virtual desktops need to have the same background setup, but that works fine for me. I couldn't find a way to set backgrounds for individual monitors and different virtual desktops.

After moving horizontal stems to match pixel grid (by offsetting them up to pixel!), Windows is having a hard time splitting 7 other pixels into three equal gaps. Unfortunately, alternative is no better:
 
What does that mean for us, programmers? If you take a font that was hand-optimized for particular pixel size (which many programming fonts are, e.g. Input at 11px or Monoid at 12px), it will be rendered blurry despite all the efforts.
 
UPD: Chris Morgan mentioned in a comment that this setting might explain why so many designers put font-weight: 300 as their default web page font. They are over-compensating for font emboldement of macOS!
 
Now, it might be tempting to use, for example, 1.5 scaling. That would give you an equivalent of 25601440 logical pixels, which, you might think, is much better. This is not how you should use it! The idea of a 4k monitor is NOT to get more pixels but to get the pixel-perfect, high-density UI rendering. Otherwise, a normal 1440p display would work better. A simple rule to remember: pixel alignment outweighs everything else. 1440p display is better at displaying 1440p content than 2160p display is at it.
 
This is what I think. PPI defines the physical size of the pixel (220 PPI means there are 220 pixels per inch, or 1 pixel is 1/220 inch wide). So Apple ensures that pixels on all its devices have the same size. Does it mean macOS controls have the same physical size? Not anymore, after Apple started applying non-integer scaling by default on Macbooks.
 
The world used to be divided into two camps: high-resolution displays and high-frame-rate displays. The former was good for text, latter for gaming, with no middle ground in between. If you like to play competitive games, buy both (and a large table). Gamers had no use for 4k displays since no reasonable game would run at 4k @ 120Hz, and the creative professionals had no use for 120 Hz in photo/text editing. I was in high-res camp since 2014, of course, and would never trade retina text rendering for barely noticeable refresh rate upgrade.
 
The whole situation reminds me of buying 4k display in 2014: there are only a couple of models, ports are confusing, Apple support sucks. Hopefully, in five years 120 Hz will become a standard. Until then we should be grateful that, at great inconvenience, we at least can use modern displays with macOS. Thanks, Apple!
 
But even at 300% it will still give you an effective logical resolution of 2
