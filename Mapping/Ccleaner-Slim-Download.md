Hello, are there any older versions availiable from CCleaner (slim)? I've got an old Embedded PC (without SSE functionality which maybe forces the error) that runs with v.5.25 (slim). Updating to 5.29 (slim) would not work. CCleaner fails to start. System is Windows XP 32bit.
 
I've found some of the versions at another "filehistory"-website, also the slim-ones. For your notice the version the old machine is able to run is 5.26.5937. After this there must be a codechange that prevents the old AMD-embedded-CPU from running ccleaner.

For many years now CCleaner has been my favourite tool for cleaning unwanted items from my computer, but since I switch to Eset Internet Security new updates from Piriform for CCleaner have been blocked from installation by the firewall, which I can't understand since it is a safe program and used by many users worldwide. So what can I do to correct this and get the latest updates again.
 
As of about the last six months to a year CCleaner is now bundled with a toolbar that ESET is correctly blocking as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program) which is kind of ironic that a cleaner program brings garbage when installed.
 
You can download CCLeaner Slim which is just the installer and not the toolbar please note that Piriform releases the slim version one week after the Standard version. It is possible that no download link is available for the Slim version during that gap time.
 
I do not have any issues with CCleaner full version and Eset. i also have PUPs enabled. It is detecting the Chrome installer or the Google toolbar installer. If you have Chrome installed already you will never see the alert anyways. It's nothing malicious. It's npt like Piriform is using Open Candy.

Exactly. As in matter of fact whenever I setup a new computer for a customer I always installed CCleaner. Never an issue. Piriform is NOT a shady company what so ever. In 10 years of using their products the most I have ever seen is Google Chrome or Google Toolbar pre packaged with the installer. But I always download only from Piriform's website.
 
Best place for me to DL CCleaner (and the excellent CCEnhancer) is Major Geeks. Never had a single issue with MG in a very long time of using their website - neither does Eset or my former Russian AV suite.
 
I have seen that some people don't understand why dropbox that comes with another software is detected, it's quite simple, it's not dropbox that they wanted to install so dropbox is the "unwanted" one in that case.
 
Now that we are back on topic ... in the very first post the OP states that "since I switch to Eset Internet Security new updates from Piriform for CCleaner have been blocked from installation by the firewall"
 
It's my understanding that ESET's **optional** setting to detect Potentially Unwanted Programs simply displays a message warning the user that the installation contains a **Potentially** Unwanted Program. ESET is in no way dictating what you should, or should not install on your computer ... hence the use of the word Potentially and the fact the entire setting is optional.
 
That being said, just to let everyone know, while I was writing this reply I tabbed over to piriform.com, clicked on the green Free Download button on the home page, and then clicked on the green Download button for the free version.
 
It appears that Piriform is no longer bundling anything with the mainstream download option, the file downloaded and I installed version 5.04 without any indication from ESET that there might be a PUP nor did I have to opt out of anything during the install (which I am used to doing for years now)
 
I just tried to download CCleaner direct from Piniform and Eset reports an issue. So it seems the toolbar is still being offered with CCleaner. If you have excluded it from detection in the past the warning does not appear. When I update I always choose "No Action" on the download and again on execution of the download.
 
Because I am updating an existing install I have never been offered the toolbar nor has there ever been a need to check, or not, anything. I believe that if you do a clean install you will be offered the toolbar with the included choice to not have it installed.
 
Interesting SCR, I have not installed CCleaner on this computer since installing ESET so it definitely is not a case of my having excluded it previously. In fact, I can't be certain but I don't think I have ever installed CCleaner on this machine.
 
Pale Moon aims to provide a Gecko-based browser with more freedom of choice than Mozilla Firefox in how people want to browse the web, which tools or extensions they wish to use, and which feedback users want to see ("Your browser, Your way"); efficiency, after all, should not stop at the engine of a browser, but extend to all parts of it, including the user interface. Specifically, Firefox has seen a redesign of the user interface after the visions of the Mozilla Firefox product directors and user experience team to provide a more minimalist interface; unfortunately also removing essential functions and making a few less logical design choices, confusing minimalism with cleanliness. Especially in Firefox 29, with "Australis", much more has been changed, breaking in many ways with previous versions, standard user interface conventions and ergonomics, as well as proper visual integration with the operating system.
