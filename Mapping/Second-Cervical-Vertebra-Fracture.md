A hangman's fracture is a break in the second vertebra of your neck, called the C2, or axis. This bone forms a ring around your spinal cord. A hangman's fracture occurs on both sides of this bone.

In elderly people, a hangman's fracture can be caused by low-impact trauma as well. This is more common in people who have conditions like osteoporosis, cancer that has spread to the bones, or vitamin D deficiency.
 
A hangman's fracture occurs when your head is forcefully snapped back and up. This is a hyperextension injury, meaning that your neck is extended beyond its normal range. While the biggest worry in many cases of neck fracture is damage to the spinal cord, a hangman's fracture doesn't usually damage the spinal cord at the time of the injury.
 
However, it can be an unstable fracture, which means the bones might move if it's not treated. If that happens, it can damage the spinal cord, which can cause pain, paralysis, or even death. Because of this, it's important for you to be checked out by a health care provider after any type of injury in which your head is snapped up and back.
 
Your doctor will do a physical exam first to check for pain or bruising. They will also check to see if you have any symptoms of spinal cord damage like numbness, weakness, or trouble breathing. You will also need imaging studies like an X-ray or a computed tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan is the best option because it can also show if the C2 bone is out of alignment with the bone below it.
 
You may also need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose a hangman's fracture. An MRI uses strong magnets, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed images. This can give your doctor a more detailed picture of the inside of your neck.

A hangman's fracture is usually classified as a particular type, depending on factors such as whether the broken bone is angled in a different direction from the bone below it, has shifted out of position, or is out of alignment with the bone below it. Knowing the type of fracture you have will help your doctor determine how it should be treated.
 
The treatment for a hangman's fracture will depend on how bad the fracture is, including how stable it is, whether there is damage to the discs in-between the vertebrae, and whether the spinal cord is involved. There are several treatment options, including:
 
**External fixation.**This type of treatment involves using a hard neck collar, called a cervical brace, or a halo vest. A halo vest is a type of brace that is used to keep you from moving your neck so that your fracture can heal. It includes a ring around your head held in place by pins attached to your skull. This ring is connected to a torso brace with rods. Approximately 90% of hangman's fractures heal with this treatment, which is also called immobilization.
 
**Internal fixation.**This type of treatment is done with surgery. It's usually only done in severe cases. Surgery can realign your bones and hold them in place with screws, rods, or plates. Surgery may also be needed if your fracture doesn't heal with immobilization.
 
If your hangman's fracture is treated appropriately, the chances are good for an excellent recovery. A review of 32 papers showed that the least severe type of hangman's fracture had a healing rate of 100% with immobilization alone. Another study of 30 people with hangman's fracture found that 85% had a full recovery within a year.
 
Registry study places the incidence of C2 fracture at 6 per 100000 people. In Sweden, of 6370 patients with C2 fractures: 51% were male, and the average age was 72 years. Those who were younger, male, and presenting with spinal cord injury were more likely to undergo surgical intervention. In the pediatric cohort, C1 to C2 injuries represented 7.7% of spine fractures presenting through a multi-institutional series following after trauma from multiple blunt mechanisms. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of C2 vertebral fractures and reviews the interprofessional team's role in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

Registry study places the incidence of C2 fracture at 6 per 100,000 people. Of 6370 patients with C2 fractures in Sweden, 51% were male, and the average age was 72 years. Those who were younger, male, and presenting with spinal cord injury were more likely to undergo surgical intervention. In the pediatric cohort, C1 to C2 injuries represented 7.7% of spine fractures presenting through a multi-institutional series following after trauma from multiple blunt mechanisms.[1][2][3][4]
 
Blunt trauma is the leading mechanism. Falls, motor vehicle accidents, assault, and other traumatic presentations usually cause blunt trauma. It is important to recognize that in the elderly cohort, low-energy cervical blunt trauma can create unstable high cervical spine fractures.[3][5][6]
 
The incidence of C2 fractures increased 135% from 2000 to 2011 in the Medicare population. C2 fractures are associated with a 20% and 40% increased risk of mortality within 3 months and 2 years, respectively. The majority of C2 fracture types are type-II dens fractures. This is troublesome because these have a pseudoarthrosis (non-union) rate that exceeds 50%.
 
It is critical to appreciate the unique anatomy of the C2 vertebra. The dens extend superiorly to communicate with C1 via the ligamentous anatomy. Lack of intervertebral discs, unique ligamentous attachments, vertebra anatomy, and vertebral artery vasculature makes this area biomechanically unique from the subaxial cervical spine. For example, C1-C2 is generally responsible for 50% of the rotation movement.[3]
 
It is important to recognize that low-energy, blunt trauma can induce significant unstable injury, especially in the elderly population. History should also entertain fracture risk factors such as osteoporosis, metastatic burden, or vitamin D deficiencies. Physical exam findings include pain with palpation in the posterior portion of the neck, radiculopathy, myelopathy, and possible posterior fossa findings secondary to vertebral artery injury. A strict neurologic exam including cranial nerves, sensory, motor, and rectal tone is mandatory.
 
Laboratory tests should be ordered as an adjunct in overall medical status. Normalized hemoglobin, hematocrit, coagulation profile with prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and platelet counts will be needed for operative intervention.
 
Evaluation of x-rays will provide limited but important information. Care must be taken to ensure proper radiographic imaging creates a picture from the occiput to the C7 through T1 disc space. This is essential in reviewing cervical spine trauma. Lateral, anteroposterior (AP), and open mouth odontoid views are necessary. Approximately 93% of cervical spine injuries are apparent with combined, lateral, AP, and odontoid view radiographs. X-rays are an excellent modality for determining alignment during the immediate injury, post-operative period, as well as long-term follow-up.
 
CT scan is the most important modality for determining fracture etiology and ruling out an injury regarding a C2 fracture. Even if plain films are negative and clinical suspicion is high, a CT scan is warranted. CT scan does not directly evaluate the spinal cord, soft tissue, or ligamentous construct. It is important to recognize the importance that complete imaging will require dedicated thin-cut CT reconstructions. Non-contrast CT scan is adequate for evaluation of the bony anatomy for fracture. This can be coupled with a CT angiogram (see below) for evaluation of the vascular anatomy.
 
Evaluation with MRI is important for analyzing the ligamentous construct, disc space, spinal cord, nerve roots, and other soft tissue injuries. MRI is also useful for determining the acute nature of the fracture when this is otherwise unknown. This is done via non-contrasted imaging. T2 signal hyperintensities and STIR changes within the dens, ligaments, or soft tissue can illustrate an acute component. MRI is less dangerous than flexion-extension cervical injury. Furthermore, MRI evaluation is mandatory in evaluating the transverse ligament for the surgical decision matrix of non-displaced type II odontoid fractures. An intact transverse ligament is needed for the anterior placement of an odontoid screw.
 
An odontoid screw can be placed for type-II odontoid fractures in good alignment with an intact transverse ligament in the acute setting. There is concern about the placement of the odontoid screw in the elderly population and instances of delayed non-union.
 
Generally, C2 fracture treatment is quite successful. A retrospective study comparing posterior cervical fusion with either C2 pedicle or C2 translaminar screws found that breach of pedicle screws occurred more frequently. The same study determined that the 1-year durability of translaminar screws is inferior to pedicle screws for subaxial fusions but equally effective for axial fusions.[11] Early management of cervical spin
