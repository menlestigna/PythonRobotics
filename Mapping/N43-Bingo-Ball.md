Just got off the Crown today, and since no one had one the snowball jackpot during our sea days, they had a special session the last night...Club Fusion was packed, with a LOT of folks trying to win the $2500 jackpot.
 
The first... and last time I played bingo.... I asked the CD what happens if someone wins the jackpot in the middle of the cruise :confused: Do you restart from the original amount, pickup from where the jackpot was won, or just cancel the rest of the games. :confused: :confused:
 
So those "cover all" games with the increasing jackpots.... the odds are astronomical in the early games that they would ever have a winner. :eek: And even the last games have to go we past the numeber of picks to get a winner.
 
Always play the last day only. Won twice, once shared a price for worst card with one other person for about $150 each. Another time won the final jackpot, again shared with one other person, each got :D a little less than $1,200. In both cases, I only played one card.
 
Once placed the final bingo prize game on a Carnival Cruise - about 10 years ago. Won the cover all which got me a cruise for 2 in a penthouse suite on any Carnival ship. Best of all, since we were in port awaiting disembarkment, technically Carnival couldn't gamble so the prize was valued at 0, so I didn't have to pay taxes either.
 
I shared the big prize on Summitt in 2006 for $1732 (my share) and did not have to pay taxes on it. However, we were on the Coral this past February and those people had to fill out the IRS form and were they upset! I wonder if it is because Carnival is a US corporation?
 
I have given the jackpot away many, many times before the final session. In fact the lowest amount of numbers was 46 - first session of the cruise !! As for somebody's calculation of $180,000, Princess would love that to be true.
 
About 3 years ago I played the last day only and won a 10 day cruise for 2--this was on a Princess ship--All the paperwork is done directly with Carnival--the cruise was with Princess--the next cruise I inquired aout the Bingo payouts--cruises etc--I was told that it was too difficult to award cruises--so that would not be done any longer
 
**Bingo** is a game of probability in which players mark off numbers on cards as the numbers are drawn randomly by a caller, the winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers. Bingo, previously known in the UK as **Housey-Housey**, became increasingly popular across the UK following the Betting and Gaming Act 1960 with more purpose-built bingo halls opened every year until 2005. Since 2005, bingo halls have seen a marked decline in revenues and the closure of many halls. The number of bingo clubs in Britain has dropped from nearly 600 in 2005 to under 400 as of January 2014. These closures are blamed on high taxes, the smoking ban, and the rise in online gambling, amongst other things.
 
The game itself, not originally called bingo, is thought to have had its roots in Italy in the 16th century, specifically, around 1530.[1] Bingo originates from the Italian lottery, *Il Gioco del Lotto d'Italia*. The game spread to France from Italy and was known as Le Lotto, played by the French aristocracy. The game is then believed to have migrated to Great Britain and other parts of Europe in the 18th century.[2] Players mark off numbers on a ticket as they are randomly called out in order to achieve a winning combination. The similar Tombola was used in nineteenth-century Germany as an educational tool to teach children multiplication tables, spelling, and even history.[3]
 
The origins of the modern version of the game and its current name bingo are unclear. Early British slang records bingo as... "A customs officer's term, the triumphal cry employed on a successful search." But it definitely gained its initial popularity with the first modern version of the game appearing at carnivals and fairs in the 1920s and is attributed to Hugh J. Ward, who most probably took the name from pre-existing slang for marketing reasons. The modern bingo card design patent went to Edwin S. Lowe in 1942.
 
The introduction of the Betting and Gaming Act 1960 on 1 January 1961 saw large cash-prizes legalised and the launch of Mecca Bingo by Mecca Leisure Group, led by Eric Morley, who had a large chain of dancehalls and introduced bingo into 60 of them, including the Lyceum Ballroom. Circuit Management Association, who managed the cinemas and dancehalls of The Rank Organisation, was the other large operator at the time, including hosting bingo at their largest cinema, the Blackpool Odeon.[4]
 
A typical bingo ticket contains 27 spaces, arranged in nine columns by three rows. Each row contains five numbers and four blank spaces. Each column contains up to three numbers, which are arranged as follows, with some variation depending on bingo companies and/or where the game is played (e.g. hall, club or online):[6][7]
 
Tickets are created as strips of 6, because this allows every number from 1 to 90 to appear across all six tickets. A player who buys a full *strip of six* is guaranteed to mark off a number every time a number is called.
 
The game is presided over by a caller, whose job it is to call out the numbers and validate winning tickets. They will announce the prize or prizes for each game before starting. The caller will then usually say "Eyes down" to indicate that they are about to start. They then begin to call numbers as they are randomly selected, either by an electronic random number generator (RNG), by drawing counters from a bag or by using balls in a mechanical draw machine. Calling may take the format of simple repetition in the framework, "Both the fives, fifty five", or "Two and three, twenty three", but some numbers have special calls due to their significance. In some independent clubs, numbers ending in a zero are described as 'blind'. So for example, thirty would be called as 'three-o blind 30' The use of blind numbers is generally restricted to independent bingo clubs, as it is not common practice in either of the largest chains of bingo club operators, Gala and Mecca bingo.
 
As each number is called, players check to see if it appears on their tickets. If it does, they mark it off with a special marker called a "dabber" or "dauber", or simply cross it off with a pen or pencil, depending on the venue. When all the numbers required to win a prize have been marked off, the player shouts in order to attract the caller's attention. There are no formal rules as to what can be shouted, but most players will shout "yes" or "bingo". Some players may also choose to shout "line" or "house" depending on the prize, whilst other
