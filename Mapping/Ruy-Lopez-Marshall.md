I was playing black and I was lost. I had to fight back from a lost postion and draw it out. well here it is please comment thanks

So he deviated from book at B x Nd4. At first glance, I like that move as it simplifies a bit, and gives you an isolated pawn. It also makes him look more behind in development, and gives you the bishop pair-- both of which can't be good in an open game.
 
For me, the worst thing that happens when my opponent goes off the books I learned from is that it often exposes the shallowness of my understanding of what I've been playing. I am very much speaking for myself here, not knocking anyone. What I like about being rated in the 12's here in blitz is that I have to deal with the craziest moves early on and either push 'em back or get killed in what ought to be a bad opening.
 
I'm sure you looked at the game explorer here and found in from the position after Qf3 that Bf4 is really good for Black no matter what white does. I'm hesitant to offer any suggestions as you're way higher rated than me, but I think there has to be something that you're way ahead on tempii and have the bishop pair in an open game. As I looked at your game I kept thinking of ways to sac something or through the king side pawns at him.
 
The purpose of the Ruy Lopez in general for both players is to control the d4, d5, e4, e5 squares. In general, White tries to open up those files and Black tries to keep them shut down. The Marshall Gambit is an attempt by Black to exert control of those squares by opening up diagonals b7-g2 and d6-h2 for the Bishops by giving up a pawn. White's play is to try to remove Black's control.

With that in mind, why didn't you play 16... Be6 allowing Black to maintain pressure on the e4 square? White could then play 17. Be3 or the more thematic 17. Bf4 forcing either an exchange of Bishops or the retreat of Black's bishop from the d6-h2 diagonal to e7 threatening the advance of the pawn to b4?
 
Thanks for the comments guys but just to clear things up a bit. I was playing black in this game. I was following what my chess book said to do. Once he stopped playing book moves I was lost. After, he made the move Bxd5. I was on my own playing
