It should be unnecessary for people to use work-arounds to install Zwift on the Nvidia Shield TV like today. It should instead be possible to install Zwift directly from the play store on the Nvidia Shield TV. Menu control should be provided by both the wireless remote and/or the gaming controller sold seperately.
 
Lack of Nvidia Shield support has me no looking for a Zwift alternative. I wanted to use my shield but kept using my apple tv. But now that I have the new shied pro, I will not keep using the apple tv. Zwift will have to be replaced as I will not go through gymnastics to make it work. Also will not use it on a tablet when my bike is in front of a 65" tv. Zwift, get your act together or competitors will start to take your business. I am gone as soon as I decide which competitor I will go with.

I own both an Nvidia Shield and an Apple TV 4K and would love to use my Shield for Zwift. The typing and navigation experience would be much better, the ancient Apple limitation of only 2 concurrent Bluetooth sensors would be gone, and the Tegra X1+ SoC should more than match the A12 Bionic.
 
The way I see it, the first step would be adding the app to the Google TV Play Store. In doing so, the service would be available to a larger, non-technical Android crowd, not just those capable of sideloading. Maybe if the userbase grew sufficiently, we could get configurable graphics and support for various remote controls further down the road.
 
I have the latest Nvidia Shield Server and the latest Nvidia Shield client running on the Nvidia Shield. This is excellent because I also have IPTV and subscribe to your live TV and DVR function which makes this literally a totally all in one solution.
 
Everything runs great with one exception that I cannot find a solution to which is when I manually add a downloaded film to the specified movies folder on the Shield how do I get Emby to see it. The only way I can get it to see it at the moment is to logon to my computer and access the server though the browser and make it do a metadata refresh. This is a bit of a pain and any added content should really show up in emby without having to do this.
 
You can click right on the job to open a new window that allows you to change how often this job runs. Instead of a default like 12 hours maybe you could change it to 1 or 2 hours depending on how long it takes for this to run and how often you are adding content. BTW, the job will tell you how long it took to run the last time it ran which is good to know.
 
Because as I stated in the first message, for example when I manually add a film to the movies folder on the shield it does not automatically appear in the Emby movies section...I have to manually use my laptop and tell the movies section to do a scan and then it will appear

And that is the point I am trying to ascertain. Is there another mechanism for forcing an update to happen immediately like there is on the laptop? As when you add something you normally want to start watching it straight away. I guess that the response will be no there isn't... So please put this down to be added as a future development to have an option for a manual scan.
 
Thanks for your reply!
I reinstall the cuda as you said and it finally works.
The L4T version I use is R24.2.1, and have you ever tried a newer L4T version like R28.2? I notice that some person says the R24.2.1 is the last version can work on shield 2015 in XDA forum. Is that true? Maybe I should try it myself.
 
I and others tried to rebuild and install R28.1 kernel on SATV but failed. It appears R28.1 root file system works partially using R24.2.1 kernel. I believe the issue is dtb.
Nvidia removed dtb files for SATV (foster) from R28.x and started to use encrypted dtb since R28.2.
It may not worth the effort to try R28.x on SATV.
 
Have an Nvidia Shield Pro that stopped responding to Control4 commands earlier today. It's using the official driver, and running Shield Experience 8.2.3 (the latest firmware). Shield Remote Services app is also on the latest/correct version. It's been working fine
 
I power cycled the Shield - no change. Took it off UUID, and added it back just using the static/reserved IP. The device is hardwired. Then I deleted the driver, and set everything back up again. None of these had any effect. All the way through, the Shield was showing as online in driver properties, and I could see the response to commands in Lua, but no actual control of the box. It would respond to the Shield remote.
 
Eventually I gave up, and used an old Videostorm IRUSB that I had laying around. The box responded straight away. So I deleted that and re-added the official Shield driver. No control again, but Lua showing a response with the correct commands. Swapped back to the IRUSB - all good again.
 
So - I changed the static IP of the Shield as a last resort. Shield driver has control again. Created a reservation, and called it good. I still have no idea what caused the problem, but it's fixed for now.
 
Same problem again today. A different Nvidia Shield Pro box, suddenly no control, even tho' I can see the commands in Lua. Have tried box reboot, controller reboot, new static IP, using IP instead of UUID. Still no control. The last time this happened, a change of IP address solved it. This time not so lucky.
 
I just had this same issue happen to me. Tried removing SDDP, changing IP address, full power cycle of shield and controller (all this many times). No luck. Just tonight, removed Static IP address in shield menu, re-identified in Composer, rebooted Shield TV in its menu and now it works again. One of the strangest things I have ran into.
 
I've had this happen twice with the latest happening just now. Both times seem to be after android updates on the shield. I have to bug my dealer to do anything in composer, so I thought I'd ask if anyone has any tips before I go that route.
 
after the update, sometimes you need a hard reset, happens to me. unplug the shield and leave it off for 30 seconds and plug it back in. it should sync back up, doing a software reboot doesn't work for some reason. you have to physically unplug it. it will come back after a couple minutes after it boots up.
 
For me the power cycle did not work. However changing the static IP address did the trick to re-establish the connection. I guess applying a new IP address forced the SDDP and Shield Remote Service to reinitialize ....??
 
There is a UPNP message sent by the shield for discovery. We can absolutely use this for device autodescovery. JuPnP should be cataloging this so we just need to pull it out of the already provided list.
 
EDIT: I dug through the PCAP files I had, there is also an MDNS query that can be sent out for them to respond to. Several actually for different things. These were in the clear so we should be able to easily query for this.
 
Given that (a) all devices are fully updates, (b) the NVidia Shield definitely works with casting (tested with other devices), (c) all devices are on the same network, and (d) I've tried with the NVidia shield both wired and wireless... I suspect something is wrong with the Quest 2.
 
So shield pro with all the updates and can't get it to go. Also is the indicator a red x in the vr unit? So I have had a green one also but nothing on the shield. Stupid question but we're talking samsung phone correct?
 
So instead, open YouTube on your phone and try casting to the shield which should cast fine. Now, close that stream and attempt to stream either from headset to Shield (so from headset menu) or through the Oculus app on your phone. Make sure headset, shield and phone all on same network and hopefully you get some success.
 
I'm having the same issues with a brand new Vizio V series tv with chromecast built in. Everything is on same network and they all see each other but all I get is casting error. The whole reason behind buying this tv was because meta said tv must have chromecast. I tried the casting from YouTube, but didn't fix the quest 2 casting error. I was able to cast from my phone using YouTube, but didn't affect the quest 2 at all.
