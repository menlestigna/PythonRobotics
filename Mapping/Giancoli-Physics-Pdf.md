Giancoli Answers was created by Shaun Dychko, a teacher with more than 12 years experience teaching high school physics and mathematics, mostly at Point Grey Secondary in Vancouver, Canada. I have taught AP Physics, and all levels of high school mathematics. I studied physics at the University of British Columbia, where I obtained both my B.Sc., and B.Ed.

It depends on what you consider "bad." Giancoli's textbook can be a useful resource for learning physics, but it may not be the best fit for everyone. Some students may find the explanations difficult to understand, while others might appreciate the clear and concise writing style.
 
Yes, there are many other textbooks available for learning physics. Some popular alternatives to Giancoli include "Fundamentals of Physics" by Halliday and Resnick, "University Physics" by Young and Freedman, and "Concepts of Physics" by Hewitt. It's important to find a textbook that suits your learning style and needs.

There could be a variety of reasons why some people may not like Giancoli's textbook. Some may find the explanations too complex or not detailed enough, others may not like the organization or structure of the book, and some may have had a negative experience with the textbook in the past.
 
Giancoli's textbook is designed for introductory physics courses, so it may not be suitable for more advanced levels of physics. However, it can still be a useful resource for reviewing basic concepts and principles.
 
The best way to determine if Giancoli's textbook is right for you is to preview the book before purchasing or using it for your class. Take a look at the table of contents, read a few chapters, and see if the writing style and explanations resonate with you. It's also helpful to ask for recommendations from peers or your instructor.
 
I am confused. It is listed under "Algebra based physics" on our master thread but I am finding syllabi that require concurrent enrollment in pre-calc. What math is needed for this? Do we need Algebra II or is Algebra I sufficient?
 
Can I ask you--did you do Chemistry first? I was contemplating doing physics next year. I own Giancoli and Hewitt's Conceptual Physics but I also own chemistry (Introductory Chemistry by Zumdahl). I had wanted to wait on the Chemistry because for some reason I thought the math level needed was higher, but I might be totally wrong.
 
I want to recommend Derek Owens. We tried using the Giancoli text alone with other videos, and it was a dismal failure. We started DO and dd is now acing the honors questions. He is a great teacher and makes the information easily understandable. If you are willing to self-grade (he will send you complete solutions), the cost is $29/mo.
 
I originally started the yr with the above. She was so frustrated. She didn't like the conceptual approach at all and wanted to understand the math behind it. I wasn't sure, but she nails the concepts when she is working through the problems. She really, really disliked the Hewitt text.
 
In terms of the contact, I honestly can't answer the question. We have rarely not understood the solutions bc he is a really good teacher. I think there have been 3 times all yr that we didnt and we just called ds to explain. I would just contact them and ask their policy. (You could always post questions on the forum, too, and I'm sure someone would be able to help you, too.)
 
Algebra based physics is physics without calculus. The real version (so not "conceptual" physics) requires trig, which is usually introduced in Algebra 2 and expanded upon in precalculus. I believe Giancoli is an algebra based college physics book.
 
We didn't use DO's course, but if I had algebra-based physics to do again, we would do it. We did his self-grading for physical science, prealgebra (actually bought the course for those back in the day), Algebra 2 and Precalculus. We used and liked the Georgia Public course, but it was after we had started and dropped another course that we didn't like and were already doing labs with friends.
 
ETA- dd has occasionally asked questions using the self-grading course, usually to a TA. It's "self-grading" not "see ya later". I did have her meet with a (very inexpensive) tutor once a week during the year she did precalculus, but dd was doing other hard math at the same time and it was mostly to give her someone to talk to about math, not really to teach concepts. Dd had some "creative" solutions sometimes, so I liked that I could just text the tutor when I was grading.
 
algebra based physics is algebra based physics, whether you teach it in college or high school.
The life science majors only require algebra based physics (as opposed to calc based, which is for all other sciences and engineering majors.
 
I originally started the yr with the above. She was so frustrated. She didn't like the conceptual approach at all and wanted to understand the math behind it. I wasn't sure, but she nails the concepts when she is working through the problems.
 
It is my experience that working problems cements conceptual understanding in a way that a sole "conceptual" approach does not. 
Working problems generates insights into the concepts you don't obtain by just talking about the idea without using math. 

 
**Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics** combines outstanding pedagogy and a clear and direct narrative with applications that draw the student into the physics at hand. The text gives students a thorough understanding of the basic concepts of physics in all its aspects, from mechanics to modern physics. Each topic begins with concrete observations and experiences that students can relate to their everyday lives and future professions, and then moves to generalizations and the more formal aspects of the physics to show why we believe what we believe.
 
**The 5th Edition** presents a wide range of new applications including the physics of digital, added approaches for practical problem-solving techniques, and new Pearson Mastering Physics resources that enhance the understanding of physics.
