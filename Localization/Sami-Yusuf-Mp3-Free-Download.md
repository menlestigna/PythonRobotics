Really enjoy this useful interview thanks for invite this man ,Mr.sami yusuf he is always inspires me with his believe :) Allah bless you all :) my best part was when he said the aya from Quran in Arabic I love this aya coz we as a Muslims everyday repeat it in our prayers :)

Moreover, I think that we need more people like him.
 I wish media would actually pay attention to Muslim intellectuals and people like Sami Yusuf to reflect the true image of Islam, rather than paying too much attention to a group of psychopaths terrorists that commit crimes in the name of Islam.
 
I also would like to say, I like the fact that, Bible and Quran possess many similarities, Christianity and Islam share a historical and traditional connection,The two faiths share a common origin, significant similarities, and spiritual elements.
 
I loved it, was beautiful and inspirational :) .. I listened to it, felt so proud that Sami Yusuf has so much spirituality in him and best part was when he quoted (cont) . really he is a great muslim artist, who make others religion worshippers to know what islam is all about :) ..am so so proud Sami Yusuf always inspire me he is a reall Muslim God bless him :)
 
Great interview! He is a real philosopher. Thanks for letting us enjoy and benefit from his deep words!
 He is an inspiration for me and many other people and the reason that makes him special because he is sincere ,honest and he do everything from his heart. God bless him and you all.
