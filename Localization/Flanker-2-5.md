Rod Power describes rod strength, which correlates directly with recommended line and lure ratings. Rod Power varies by style of rod. For example, a Medium Heavy inshore rod is different than a Medium Heavy surf rod.
 
**Reel** sizes vary by manufacturer. To best understand the size of a spinning reel or casting reel, refer to the line capacity rating for the reel. Size standards are consistent across our reels.

The Zilla Flanker is a shallow running wobbler that has a steady flanking action on a steady retrieve. Fished fast or slow, this flanker will run perfect and catch loads of fish. When jerked/twitched it flashes side-to-side and has erratic movements. The Weight Ramp system ensures long and precise casts. Diving depth: 0,5 - 1,5+m
 
I know the Su-27 has a lot to offer, and I have been trying to unlock that "sweet spot" where I am enjoying the Flankers special characteristics to my advantage in a dogfight without getting too bogged down by its dangerous quirks.
 
**My question, when do you experienced Flanker pilots actually go ahead and use the flankers instantaneous high AoA capability? Give me a common scenario where you really pull back on the stick.**
 
The nasty stall characteristics and lack of power of the Su27 means that if I decide to follow my target up I need to break off the chase and put my nose down around 450kph so I don't stall out. Not only is this almost always before my target has to drop his nose, but it happens extremely quickly (10,000 feet? if that?). Essentially forcing me to expose my tail as I drop off prematurely if I haven't nailed him with my cannon (which I usually do, but still).
 
**My question. Given the above assumptions what do you all do when the target goes vertical? Set yourself up to catch him on the way down? gain altitude on a different heading and at a less aggressive climb rate?**
 
I can`t believe that trim is in RL Su27 very bad as in DCS. I saw many cockpit videos about Su27 and never see pilot that triming plane constantly. In DCS after every move we lose a bit speed and must trim, again and again... If not change trim we have results from OP observations.
 
I typically trim to about 600kph before the dog-fight and leave the trimmer as is so I will have a more compliant nose when I go guns (usually 500-600kph range). You think the loss of energy in vertical is coming from trim? That's interesting but I can't see why, can you explain more?
 
What's your bandit doing? Are you slow, he's fast, and you're still blowing all your energy? Why not a sustained turn instead? Do you really have to stick him in your HuD right away and try to gun him? Why?
 
If your opponent is at 800kph, and you're at 450 ... why are you even trying to follow him up? Maybe you have a good reason - your dogfight missile might be able to catch up with him so it's worth a shot. Maybe you don't have a good reason, but you really like sticking him in your HuD (ie. you are a hud-fighter).
 
Hi AOA is nice to have available when you are stuck in pure of lag pursuit to pull your nose ahead of the target for a shot. Usually it also allows you to fly very slow, which is also useful in a scissors or rolling scissors manoeuvre.
 
When your target goes vertical, of course you should follow him. If you can't it probably is because he has more energy than you, so you better end the fight quick on the way up or he will be in your 6 on the way down.
 
When you don't have the energy to follow him, you can unload your aircraft (level wings, 1G), accelerate and follow him when you can. But the longer you wait, the more turning room you are giving to him.
 
Escaner's advice about gaining velocity for a second before going vertical is something I'm going to pay attention to next time (will try today). In the meantime GGtharos I want to drill down a little deeper and try and get more specific knowledge out of you about when **you** use high AoA menuevers in the 27, read below.
 
Quite the opposite. I have found **I do not really ever find it worth it to use the 27's high aoa turning capability because of the consequences (loss of energy\altitude, sluggish nose) are too great.** Which, to answer your question more specifically means rather than stick the enmy in my hud I tend to play the Su-27 as a very lag pursuit kind of jet because I fall out of the sky otherwise.
 
My question to you GGTharos, with all due respect of course and if this is actually possible, is how can I use my high AoA/instant turn, in whole **or in part** in a way that does not rely on making an instant kill and will put me in a good position should the dogfight continue? EG: sustainable use of super maneuverability.
 
Boy. We all show up at once, don't we? :) And I am far from an expert, when it comes to dogfighting. But the thing about that high instantaneous turn rate is that it's, well..., gone in an instant. You can't hold onto it, and once you've used it, you have to work to get it back. It's kind of like a paycheck. Cash it, spend it, and you're done until you earn more. So use it only when you know it'll pay big dividends. Otherwise, try to fly at a high enough airspeed, if your opponent will let you, that your maximum instantaneous turn rate is always available for when the right moment comes.
 
I think your underlying premise is that, with each aircraft configured similarly and carrying 30% fuel, they are more or less equal in weight. They aren't. That setup leaves the Flanker weighing roughly 1/2 again as much as the the Eagle. So, in that scenario, the Eagle is much lighter to begin with. So, perhaps, what's happening isn't all that exceptional.
 
There is NO other DCS AC what people talking that much about a strange FM like the DCS Su27, and that's not because they are all "noobs". The DCS Su27 FM behaves strange, even for or just because this AC is one of the most agil ACs in DCS.
 
Then I'd say you didn't have enough energy to do what you wanted to do to begin with, but that's a very simplistic answer. Your high turn rate is used to gain angles. You can then continue to increase this initial advantage. But note there's a difference between a screeching break-turn right onto high six and a max performance turn to gain 30 degrees of angles. That difference is counted in lost airspeed. :)
 
You have no super maneuverability. Forget that idea right now, it's not available to you. The flanker flies like any other aircraft: It gets sluggish t slow speeds, and loses speed in high AoA turns. It isn't magical and doesn't have thrust vectoring.
 
The flanker can't recover it's corner quite as fast as an eagle if you get it slow (but again ... it depends). On the other hand if you get the eagle slow too, the flanker will generally out-perform it if they're at the same altitude.
