However, due to the mass-volume relationship of water being based on a number of factors that can be cumbersome to control (temperature, pressure, purity, isotopic uniformity), as well as the discovery that the prototype of the kilogram was slightly too large (making the liter equal to 1.000028 dm3 rather than 1 dm3), the definition of the liter was reverted to its previous, and current definition.

**Current use:** The liter is used to measure many liquid volumes as well as to label containers containing said liquids. It is also used to measure certain non-liquid volumes such as the size of car trunks, backpacks and climbing packs, computer cases, microwaves, refrigerators, and recycling bins, as well as for expressing fuel volumes and prices in most countries around the world.
 
**Definition:** A gallon is a unit of volume specifically regarding liquid capacity in both the US customary and imperial systems of measurement. The US gallon is defined as 231 cubic inches (3.785 liters). In contrast, the imperial gallon, which is used in the United Kingdom, Canada, and some Caribbean nations, is defined as 4.54609 liters. In both systems, the gallon is divided into four quarts. Quarts are then divided into two pints and pints are divided into two cups. A cup is comprised of two gills, making one gallon equal four quarts, eight pints, sixteen cups, or thirty-two gills. Further differentiating the US and the imperial gallon, a US gill is divided into four fluid ounces, while an imperial gallon is divided into five. A US fluid ounce is therefore 1/128 of a US gallon while an imperial fluid ounce is 1/160 of an imperial gallon.
 
**History/origin:** The term gallon most closely originates from "galon" in Old Northern French and developed as a system for measuring wine and beer in England, resulting in measures such as the wine gallon, ale gallon, and imperial gallon.
 
**Current use:** In the United States (US), gallons are often used for larger containers, such as half gallon tubs of ice cream or one-gallon cartons of milk. Gallons are also widely used in fuel economy expression in the US, as well as some of its territories. The imperial gallon is used even more sparingly than the US gallon, with most countries around the world using liters when referencing fuel.

A liter is a unit of volume equal to 1,000 cubic centimeters or 0.264172 US gallons.[1] The liter is a special name defined for the cubic decimeter and is exactly equal to the volume of one cubic decimeter (1 decimeter is 1/10 of a meter, or 10 centimeters).
 
The US liquid gallon is a unit of fluid volume equal to four quarts, eight pints, or sixteen cups.[2] The US liquid gallon should not be confused with the US dry gallon or the imperial gallon, which are different units of measure.
 
Use the following tables and information to convert metric container sizes to U.S. gallons when computing taxable quantities of distilled spirits and wine. Also see current tax rates for distilled spirits and wine.
 
For the examples above, the conversion from liters to U.S. units was made before multiplying by the number of cases and the quantity in U.S. units is rounded **to the sixth decimal**, as required under 19.582(a). If the conversion from liters to U.S. units is made after multiplying by the number of cases, the quantity in U.S. units must be rounded to the nearest hundredth (i.e., second decimal) see 19.582(b). Once converted to wine gallons, the proprietor must determine the proof gallons of spirits in cases (see 27 CFR 30.52).
 
A common inquiry IBC Tanks receives is regarding the IBC tote volume capacities for IBC totes and their availability in Metric Liter (L) units. Intermediate bulk containers made in the United States are engineered and provided using U.S. common measurements of gallons. With this said however, many IBC products that include external gallonage markers also include the accompanying volume value in liters.
 
For the products themselves, they are branded and advertised in U.S. gallons. The following tables provide a conversion of IBC tote volumes from gallons to liters and lists products available in those sizes.
 
Caged IBC totes are composite type intermediate bulk containers with a blow-mold manufactured high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle supported and protected by a galvanized steel cage and pallet style platform base.
 
Plastic IBC totes are intermediate bulk containers that are rotational mold manufactured entirely from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. Plastic IBCs are available in a wide range of model types, storage volume capacities and options to suit many different applications.
 
Metal IBC totes are intermediate bulk containers manufactured from metal sheets welded together. Metal IBCs are made from either stainless steel or carbon steel. Compared to plastic IBC totes, metal IBCs provide improved physical durability and select compatibility ideal for certain applications.
 
Hidden water is water that is not felt or seen and it is required for almost every step in the production processes for many raw materials and finished products. The water footprint of a product is calculated by adding up all of the water required for each step of the production process. Table 1 lists a sampling of water footprints for the manufacturing of some common consumer goods.
 
**Grey Water Footprint:** The amount of freshwater required to dilute the wastewater generated in manufacturing, in order to maintain water quality, as determined by state and local standards.
 
Phones are composed of many pieces created in multiple steps, and each step consumes water. Numerous resources, materials and parts go into smartphone manufacturing, including rare earth metals (e.g., lithium), tin, glass and plastics. The supply chains for these materials stretch around the world to places like Indonesia, the Philippines and China. Production might include steps like mining for precious metals, creating synthetic chemicals for glue and plastic and assembling and packaging. Collectively, the water associated with each step adds up to the blue water footprint.
 
In addition, manufacturing the parts creates wastewater that is released into surrounding waterways. Those waterways often have pollution limits that manufacturers must meet before they can send their wastewater down the pipe and into the waterway. The water used to clean and dilute the wastewater adds up to the grey water footprint, and in the case of the smartphone, makes up the largest portion of its total water footprint.
 
To meet all of these needs, industrial facilities in the US withdraw over 15.9 billion gallons of water per day. Fortunately, due to increasingly efficient manufacturing practices, most factories have reduced water use by 12 percent since 2005, and 33 percent since 1970.
 
Nobody will have a water footprint of zero because it takes water to make just about everything we choose to buy, eat, use and throw away. Individual daily decisions might seem small, but cumulatively they can have a great impact.
 
Before going to the liters to gallons formula, let us recall what are "liters" and "gallons". These are the units of volume that are used to measure liquids. "Liter" is the SI unit of volume in the metric system and it can be abbreviated using the letters **l** (or) **L**. "Gallon" is a customary unit of volume in the US and it can be abbreviated as a ***gal**.*
 
The name says it all, our l to gal converter will convert any quantity in liter to gallon and gallon to liter. Yes, it works both ways, for your convenience.
Not only will you learn how to convert l to gal and vice versa, but we'll share some amazing volume converters, that will surely come in handy for you.
 
The l to gal converter is a tool that converts the **volume of liquids**. In this case, the specific units are liters and gallons. But that doesn't mean the tool is limited to just that. You have a list of other units to choose from as well.
A liter is the volume measurement in the metric system, while a gallon is the volume measurement in the imperial system. Since both measure the volume of a substance, the only thing required to convert from one to the other is the conversion ratio.

Before we discuss how to convert between liters and gallons, it's worth mentioning that there are two different gallon measurements. The US gallon and the imperial (UK) gallon. The US gallon issmaller than its imperial counterpart, so it's important to know which gallon you're referencing before you do your conversion. To fully assist youwith your calculations, we've included conversion data for both US and imperial gallons.
 
Of course, it may be that you're wanting to convert from a **price per liter** to a **price per gallon**. If so, we've got you covered with our calculator and these useful charts...
 
The liter stands as a metric volume unit within the International System of Units (SI). It is widely adopted worldwide and is represented by the symbol "L." One liter equates to 1,000 cubic centimeters (cc) or onecubic decimeter (dm). Its applications span the measurement of vari
