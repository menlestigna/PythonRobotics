After some research, found out it was harmless and recommended that I uninstall avast! for an alternative. So I uninstall avast with the uninstaller it came with, however, now when I check my console log, every 10 seconds it shows a log for "com.avast.helper" that says "Error connecting to master socket: connect ( ) : No such file in directory". How can I permanently stop this, and possibly remove any remaining fragments left from avast!? I tried going into my library, but the application folder for avast! was no longer there.
 
Open Avast! Preferences and uncheck or "open" File System Shield and disable it. (If you are on line and not downloading anything, then you are still protected. I disconnected from my router to do this stage.)

Return to finder and select the first part of the system pass and get it to allow you to choose that path as part of the exclusion. That will copy the path to the "Exclusion" window on Avast! It may take trial and error to get it to appear, but you will get at least part of it to move. Then you can edit and add the rest of the filepath to the exclusion window.
 
After you do this, either click done, or repeat the process until all the inaccurately identified files are added. You can also add the entire Library or other folder to the exclusions, but I suggest not doing that, since in the unlikely event you are infected with malware, it might go unnoticed.
 
Most OS X applications are completely self-contained "packages" that can be uninstalled by simply dragging the application to the Trash. Applications may create preference files that are stored in the /Home/Library/Preferences/ folder. Although they do nothing once you delete the associated application, they do take up some disk space. If you want you can look for them in the above location and delete them, too.
 
Some applications may install an uninstaller program that can be used to remove the application. In some cases the uninstaller may be part of the application's installer, and is invoked by clicking on a Customize button that will appear during the install process.
 
Some applications may install components in the /Home/Library/Applications Support/ folder. You can also check there to see if the application has created a folder. You can also delete the folder that's in the Applications Support folder. Again, they don't do anything but take up disk space once the application is trashed.
 
Some applications may install a startupitem or a Log In item. Startupitems are usually installed in the /Library/StartupItems/ folder and less often in the /Home/Library/StartupItems/ folder. Log In Items are set in the Accounts preferences. Open System Preferences, click on the Accounts icon, then click on the LogIn Items tab. Locate the item in the list for the application you want to remove and click on the "-" button to delete it from the list.

If an application installs any other files the best way to track them down is to do a Finder search using the application name or the developer name as the search term. Unfortunately Spotlight will not look in certain folders by default. You can modify Spotlight's behavior or use a third-party search utility, EasyFind, instead.
 
Some applications install a receipt in the /Library/Receipts/ folder. Usually with the same name as the program or the developer. The item generally has a ".pkg" extension. Be sure you also delete this item as some programs use it to determine if it's already installed.
 
The simple reboot that Kappy suggested seemed to work guys (thanks Kap!). It kept logging even after I uninstalled avast!, but after the reboot, no more logs. On another note, anyone familiar with the bootloader warning? The file it was warning me about was a ".dmg", and depending on where I was searching, some people said that "all .dmg files are downloaded and if its bootloader.dmg then it's a virus or malware" but I've seen some that say it's harmless and an factory-installed part of OS X. Can anyone shed some light? I'm fairly new to mac, and I worry sometimes about my computer's safety.
 
I just uninstalled avast via its own uninstaller and I realized there is some empty folders and registry record that it left. I tried to delete them with normal methods but I could'nt. so I re-installed avast and tried to delete any files that stored in avast folder and registry keys. but I still cant to modify or delete them. I searched in whole net to understand how can it possible but I can't find any basic answer that explain it. There is only way to delete it via its own uninstaller. and even it uninstalled still some registry and folders cant be deleted.
 
And now I don't want to delete it anymore, I want to know how it can't be deleted. I tried almost all forced methods. Unlockers, taking ownership methods, safeboot, full access user, modified win ISOs etc.
 
I hope this isn't glaringly obvious, if so forgive me. I would first open CCleaner/Tools and use the uninstaller in there which always works for me. But some programs leave bits behind. Look in your C: Windows folder for the two Program folders, 'Files' and 'Data', and carefully delete everything under the program name. Also look for folders under its provider's name, occasionally they're different but the entry in CCleaner's uninstaller shows it. Finally, run updated CCleaner 'Health Check', its registry cleanout, and the Windows drive cleaner. Sorry if you've done all that. If it doesn't/didn't help you have a more stubborn program than I've ever come across. But I do vaguely remember having to repeat it all a few times for one of the free malware prog's, it might have been Avast ; they don't like to be dumped ! Best of luck, these things can be infuriating ! Robjn
