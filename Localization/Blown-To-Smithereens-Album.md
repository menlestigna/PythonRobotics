(One lucky buyer got a special bonus: a free living room show from Pat himself.) It's long been sold out, so here it is in all its glory - nearly 27 hours of demos, rehearsals, outtakes and live performances. Obviously, this is meant for completists, so if you have any interest in this torrent, I urge you to buy the new Smithereens album, "Smithereens 2011" which is a fantastic return to form.

'especially for you' is one of my favourite 80s records ever. yes, the lyrics are trite and scrape tiresomely from the bottom of the cliche-barrel ....
Don't agree. The lyrics are straightforward and direct, lacking in wordplay or unusual rhymes, but not at all cliched.

Especially For You one of the best of the '80s - "Strangers When We Meet", "Behind the Wall of Sleep", and "In a Lonely Place" would be worth the cost of the CD, or even twice the cost of the CD i bought when it was new. Green Thoughts was a decent follow-up, although it felt like a sequel - a bit of a retread of the earlier album but still nearly as good. I still don't know why the song "Especially For You" is on the latter album rather than the album of the same name.
 
Boo. That last-U2-album-you-bought thread reminded me that a girl I liked in high school gave me a taped copy of Joshua Tree which I didn't like much but I REALLY liked what she had on the b-side: Especially For You. That album is wall to wall hooks.
 
I heard "Only a Memory" on the radio and made my mom buy the tape (in a mall record store), which she liked better than I did (though I still really like that song). At some point 10+ years ago or so, I sat next to him on an airplane and 1) he recognized the book I was reading and we chatted about it. He was a really nice guy who treated me like a human being. He was with a child I believe was his daughter. RIP, too soon!!
 
my first bass teacher was an older college kids who was into "college rock" when I was a little 13/14 rat who wanted to learn Whitesnake and Maiden stuff, anyway he introduced me to REM and also really insisted I learn "Blood and Roses" (which really has a very nice, simple and very melodic bassline) so I always had a certain place in my heart for this band. RIP.
 
it was a really nice memory! we were stuck by the bathrooms and utterly crammed into a much-too-small spot for three people. the potential for bad things happening was huge, and nothing bad happened at all. he seemed like a standup guy. plus he knew harvest home and we talked about the widow fortune, and how bette davis played her in the tv miniseries (which is now available on dvd, i learned recently!)
 
Saw the smithereens outside Detroit with a cousin back in '95, and we were both impressed with how friendly and approachable DiNizio was after the show, the three of us chatting about Rickenbackers and other stuff for maybe ten minutes. Nice guy.

11 was big in my dad's cd rotation for a few years when i was growing up. i doubt i've heard it since '92 or so but damned if i couldn't summon the "girl like you" riff instantly. i'll give it a listen tomorrow. r.i.p.
 
I first heard/saw them on IRS' The Cutting Edge, must've been late summer or early fall of 1986. They scratched a number of itches: loose, propulsive drumming; hooks; easy-to-play songs (I started playing guitar that year, and quickly learned "Blood & Roses," "Behind The Wall Of Sleep," and a few others); and Rickenbackers! Coming off a Jam obsession, whenever I saw a band with Rickenbackers I figured they must have something decent happening. I really dug Especially and Green Thoughts, but never kept up with them after that (and I desperately wanted to see them live in '86-'87, but going to a show alone on a school night was always a non-starter with my parents). I should probably listen to their version of Tommy.
 
Saw them a few times in the Green Thoughts/11 era whenever they came through LA. Never met Pat, but did talk to a super-boisterious Jim Babjak who gave me a guitar pick, revealed that the secrets to their songs was to tune the guitars down a step and play the Kinks ("tune down twice and you'll get Sabbath!") and said that playing on stage with Dave Davies was like playing baseball with Mickey Mantle.
 
*SMITHEREENS* might not have blown standards to smithereens, but it is undeniably Joji and so it delivers. The softened, minimalistic beats harken back to his earlier releases, returning to his SoundCloud roots. Yet the album evolves that unfinished yet polished lofi sound, as Joji takes a darker and more mature approach to music in a way that is sure to please both old and new audiences.
 
If you're a fan of science fiction, you'll have seen some pretty crazy things, up to time travel and the destruction of entire planets! We saw poor Spock's home planet Vulcan destroyed in Star Trek, and in Star Wars Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan was blown to smithereens.
 
When a star like our Sun runs out of fuel to burn, its outer layers drift away into space, leaving just the very centre. For this star, and the Sun, that will be a ball about the size of Earth (over a million times smaller), which is hot, dense and really bright. This is called a white dwarf star.
 
One day, the planet appears to have strayed too close to the star and was ripped apart. Parts of it were then gobbled up by the white dwarf.**Cool fact:** Although we call them white dwarfs, these stars aren't always white, they can also have orange, red or even blue tinges!

While BAD rock critie Ken Emerson co-reviewing the album with releases by the Gratcfui Dead and Terry Reid, says "the Beaules have dropped to a point of musical insignificance."
