It is a proxy server computer that acts as an intermediary and privacy shield between a client computer and the rest of the Internet. It accesses the Internet on the user's behalf, protecting personal information of the user by hiding the client computer's identifying information such as IP addresses.[1][2][3] Anonymous proxy is the opposite of transparent proxy, which sends user information in the connection request header.[4] Commercial anonymous proxies are usually sold as VPN services.
 
Some countries apply heavy censorship on the internet.[5][6][7][8][9] Anonymizers can help to allow free access to all of the internet content, but they cannot help against persecution for accessing the anonymizer website itself. Furthermore, as information itself about anonymizer websites are banned in those countries, users are wary that they may be falling into a government-set trap.[10]

Anonymizers are also used by people who wish to receive objective information with the growing target marketing on the internet and targeted information. For example, large news outlets such as CNN target the viewers according to region and give different information to different populations. Websites such as YouTube obtain information about the last videos viewed on a computer, and they propose "recommended" videos accordingly, and most of the online targeted marketing is done by showing advertisements according to that region. Anonymizers are used for avoiding that kind of targeting and getting a more objective view of information.[11]
 
Sometimes anonymizers are implemented to work only with one particular protocol. The advantage is that no extra software is needed. The operation occurs in this manner: a connection is made by the user to the anonymizer. Commands to the anonymizer are included inside a typical message. The anonymizer then makes a connection to the resource specified by the inbound command and relays the message with the command stripped out.
 
An example of a protocol-specific anonymizer is an anonymous remailer for e-mail. Also of note are web proxies and bouncers for FTP and IRC. Potentially anonymity integrated with RFID tags could pose as an option.[13]
 
In this case either the desired application must support the tunneling protocol, or a piece of software must be installed to force all connections through the tunnel. Web browsers, FTP and IRC clients often support SOCKS for example, unlike telnet.
 
Proxies can be daisy chained. Chaining anonymous proxies can make traffic analysis far more complex and costly by requiring the eavesdropper to be able to monitor different parts of the Internet.[1] An anonymizing remailer can use this concept by relaying a message to another remailer, and eventually to its destination.
 
Even stronger anonymity can be gained by using Tor. Tor is not merely a proxy chain, but an onion router, which means that routing information (as well as message content) is encrypted in such a way as to prevent linking the origin and destination. Like all anonymity networks, Tor cannot end-to-end encrypt messages destined for the public internet;[14] it must be arranged between the sender and recipient. Tor's onion service protocol does, however, provide end-to-end encryption, along with the ability to anonymize servers, making them more censorship-resistant.

Another anonymity network is the Invisible Internet Project (I2P). Unlike Tor, I2P is a fully internal network. The philosophy behind I2P is that each node routes traffic for others and blends its own traffic in, whereas one's own traffic will be relayed by other peers through so-called tunnels made up of various other peers. As you never know if a given mix logs all connections or not, the only way to be really sure there is no logging is to run your own anonymizing mix node and blend your traffic with those of other users. These other users do not need to trust you, as they blend their traffic with yours and other users' traffic in their own mix nodes. The network is highly dynamic and fully decentralized. It also takes care of other nodes learning about your node existing, for without peers using your node, there would be no traffic to blend yours with. As all traffic always stays within the I2P network, a routing user's I2P can remain end-to-end encrypted and will never show on public websites' logs.[15]
 
Examples of anonymizer websites include Anonymouse, Anonymiz.com, Anonymize, Anonymizer, IDZap, Ultimate Anonymity, The Cloak, GoTrusted and GhostSurf Platinum.[16] Websites such as GoTrusted.com and Anonymizer.com offer users internet access with anonymity through the payment of a subscription fee. Users pay to route their online traffic through the companies' servers, typically using a VPN. [17]
 
About 3.8 billion people are online every day. From sharing content to collecting data for organizational purposes, there are about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being processed by Google every day. Not all data is available to all people around the world. For example, a show on Netflix in one country may not be available in another country. This is due to restrictions and copyrights imposed by the government of the respective country. Web proxy is the easiest way to access all restricted content without having to install any kind of software.
 
A web proxy allows you to browse the web anonymously and unblock your favorite websites without installing software, like a VPN. Our web proxy is free and supports the most popular websites, such as YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and adult entertainment websites. All your traffic is encrypted while browsing to make sure you stay anonymous.
 
A Web Proxy has its own IP address, which acts as the intermediary between the user and the internet. Once the user requests information online, the request is routed via a web proxy, the web proxy retrieves the information from the targeted website, then sends it to the user. This way the user's local IP address is masked.
 
For an average user, a web proxy helps to access the restricted content behind geoblocking in websites and streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. This is carried out without compromising the internet connectivity speed. With Proxyium, you can surf restricted websites without annoying ads and other constraints. Simply paste the URL or type the website name and you will be directed to the website home page. It's that quick and simple.
 
The second aspect of the need for web proxy is to improve network performance. For example, let us say that you visited an XYZ website in the morning. The web proxy saves the data from the webpage temporarily, so when you visit it again in early noon, it actually serves you a copy of the webpage and reduces the latency.
 
Web proxy servers and VPNs both act as an intermediary between the user and a website. Web proxies and VPNs both receive a request from the user, get a response from the targeted websites, and route it to the user again. The main differences between proxy servers and VPNs are how they work and which protocols they support, which affects their privacy and security capabilities.
 
VPNs are typically configured at a system level, allowing all traffic to pass through them, i.e., web browsing, music streaming, file sharing, or gaming. Many VPN software solutions allow users to exclude selected apps from operating through the VPN, but the default settings usually direct all traffic through them.
 
On the other hand, a web proxy can be accessed directly from the browser and does not require software installation. However, the disadvantage is that a web proxy can only open websites and can not mask your IP address for other applications on your device. A web proxy is ideal if you quickly need to visit a blocked website without downloading any type of software.
 
No, a web proxy uses cache memory, which stores the data temporarily about the webpage you visited. If you want to visit that webpage again, the web proxy provides you with a copy of the webpage, which reduces the latency.
 
If you are a person who does not want to install dedicated software on your computer for simple web surfing, a web proxy is the best solution for you. Our web proxy provides you the best access to all the restricted sites without compromising on qualities like internet speed and connectivity.
 
Right now we do not do Geo-Blocking, but have had a rash of Proxy address attempting to scrape the data from the site. We have added Capcha checks, and a blocking system if an IP does certain requests.
This is a Unique situation,.
 
Maxmind publishes both a download able DB and an API that can be used for geo-fencing/location as well as anonymous proxy detection. They are pretty accurate. The download is updated once a month, and the API is constantly updated.
 
I am making an app which makes lots of api calls to some site. The trouble I've run into is that the site has a limit on the number of api calls that can be made per minute. To get around this I was hoping to use Tor in conjunction with node-http-proxy to create a proxy table which uses anonymous ip addresses taken from the tor api.
 
Now, we can send requests through this local tor proxy which will establish a "circuit" through the TOR network. Let's see our IP address using You can copy paste all of these things into your Node REPL:
 
**Note:** There is another way I've seen people describe getting a new IP address (setting up a new "circuit") on the fly, but it only seems to work about 10% of the time in my tests. If you want to try it:
 
After sometime i found kerio application and i have been using this application for quite sometime, and **it is awesome**!! It does NOT l
