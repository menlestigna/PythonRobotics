Exiled from her homeland after winding up on the wrong side of a civil war in her country from the World Government, she has since lead a life of piracy across the seas.

A moderate-sized woman, Sera Phim is not an imposing figure by any means. Standing at an average 182 centimeters, many across the sea tower over her, yet she doesn't seem all that small. Sera radiates an air of quiet confidence that seems to make the angel seem far larger than a simple view of her would suggest. In later years this effect is still present, but is amplified by a much more fiery look in the Angel's gaze, giving her a more imposing presence.
 
In terms of looks, Sera has respectable looks with alabaster skin and golden hair. While Sera , people find themselves drawn to her sparkling sapphire gaze. Her body is muscular and toned, as befitting a former knight. Sera's body is also noticeably scarred, from the gash across her left side to the burn marks that mar her upper right arm and shoulder[4].
 
She always stands tall, as if at attention, which is a holdover from her past. This posture may seem to make her unapproachable, but the warm smile she sports helps her come off as a friend, even to those that would normally consider her enemies.

Her normal attire consists of a blue shirt attached by some ties at her neck. This allows her to manifest her wings without destroying her outfit in the process. In addition, she wears semi-loose leggings underneath an armored skirt. Her legs are covered with steel boots, which also double as her shoes. These are used to support her brawling style of fighting.
 
By 1580, Sera has shown to become much more used to her transformations. No longer keeping her back bare to allow her wings to manifest, she has begun wearing a button up shirt and vest, adopting a far more businesslike look than her previous outfit of convenience. She keeps her hair in a loose ponytail for convenience, but overall keeps a dignified demeanor in her cobalt gray suit. Her boots have received an upgrade as well, as during the years she spent in the arena she had won a pair of Adamantine boots, which she has christened Prydwen. These boots are a teal color in appearence with silver furnishings along the outside to provide a more visual flair.
 
By 1584, Sera seems to have ditched the jacket, wearing just a dress shirt with her suit-like pants. She also has begun to wear her hair down, albeit will still corral it into a loose ponytail when she needs to. She also regularly wears a pair of dark sunglasses out in public, presumably to make her slightly harder to identify when her fruit isn't active.
 
Once Sera activates her devil fruit's transformation abilities, the first thing that is noticeable is a halo upon her head that lights up as she begins to call upon her abilities. A soft ring of golden light, it floats around six inches off the top of her head, and will show up regardless of Sera's desires as she begins to use her abilities.
 
While her basic hybrid transformation does produce much in the way of physical changes to Sera, unlike many other zoan devil fruits, it does produce one in particular. While using her transformation, Sera may be seen sporting anywhere from one to ten snow-white wings. While she has an even number manifested, they will be symmetrically grown out of her back, while with odd ones one will be missing it's pair.
 
Activating Bright Furnace sees a much bigger change in Sera's appearance, with her look becoming much more wild and unrefined. Fire constantly flows from the corner of her mouth as she exhales the flames she has internalized. This collects into her hair and wings, leaving both raging with golden fire. In this form she is almost constantly surrounded with a flaming aura, the refined knight turned into the fiery warrior made manifest.
 
Sera is a kind person at heart, overall a rather gentle being. She is well-liked by her crew and respected by her companions. She was a distinguished member of the Flower Knights before the civil war and was held in high regards even by her enemies during the drawn-out conflict. While she is a disciplined being, as befitting her social status, she knows when to be stern and when to be kind. She is even willing to extend mercy to those who have attacked her, as shown when she had Serena Gratzianowi's wounds treated before releasing her after the woman had attacked her ship and severely burned Sera[5][6].
 
She is a very masculine character in terms of personality, not caring for more feminine roles or traits. She doesn't shy away from hard work, and even enjoys it. You are far more likely to find her working out, enhancing her physique than ever to find her sitting down and getting her nails polished.
 
As a firebrand in the ranks before she was exiled from her kingdom, Sera is an extremely headstrong woman, unchanging in her motivations or convictions even when the easier path might be to just go to the flow. She stuck by her lord, ready to accept her own death before she allowed herself to be dishonored by switching sides, unlike many. If he hadn't ordered her to escape the kingdom, she honestly would have died defending him. She has only ever run during combat once, and that event still haunts her to this day. This shame of hers manifests as a protectionist streak, causing her to be incredibly defensive about her crew, going to great lengths to protect them from harm. She even was referred to as a Mother Hen by Gratzianowi Serena for rushing to the aid of her men so quickly.
 
Her willpower is immense, having fought in situations she knew might kill her out of honor and her own stubbornness. Examples include when she fought to protect a column of civilians from an approaching army while already on the brink of exhaustion[7], or when she utilized all of her power to protect Yenny Town from Tom Glynn's attack when she could have easily just protected herself[8], to standing firm against Serena's explosion in order to make sure the other woman couldn't escape to attack her ship further[5].
 
Sera has shown to be extremely protective of her crew, even being called a Mother Hen by Serena for how quick she was to protect them. She has shown to be more than willing to suffer severe injury to keep them safe. However even by 1581, by which the organization had grown significantly, Sera had still shown the same level of care to her members. She was more than willing to defend them without forcing them to risk themselves on little to no notice, and even still knew the entire crew of six hundred by name.
 
Sera trusts and relies on Augus to keep the ship running whenever she is not directly commanding the crew directly[9]. She also is shown to care about him, asking him to make sure to be careful when he went off to the marine's ship, and then rushing out to save him when he was defeated.
 
Sera's trust for Augus has been mostly at the forefront of their friendship, as Augus has been her first mate for nearly a decade now. Even in the light of his perceived betrayal during the encounter with Ogre Andre noted that if it had been anyone but Augus and Ovis that had pulled the stunt they did they'd have been in severe trouble. While she wishes he'd be more proactive in running things, she understands his nature and generally nocturnal behavior isn't something he necessarily has control over.
 
Later on, it was stated by Andre that Sera gives a fair amount of leniency to Augus, as he noted that if it had been anyone but Augus and Ovis who had interrupted her fight like that, even in one of the outbuildings of the village he and Ogre would be in the blast radius of her fury.[10].
 
A relatively early addition to the crew, Sera and Nathaniel have known each other for nearly eight years now. While not the closest on the crew due to Sera's slight off-put opinion due to Nathaniel's sometimes strange behavior, she none-the-less has shown similar levels of protectiveness over her musician as the rest of her crew.
 
Sera initially was extremely confused with her meeting of Ovis, as she found the man occupying her bed. This led her to become extremely familiar with his devil fruit. Sera has since then been extremely wary of Ovis's abilities due to her susceptibility to them[11]. She has however been relatively gentle with the man and cares about him like the rest of her crew.
 
By 1581, Sera still trusts Ovis, though she can get exasperated with him at times. She is generally gentle with him due to his tendency to pull the wool over her, but that doesn't stop her from knowing how to punish the helmsman when he does manage to make her angry, as shown during the encounter with Ogre as she poured a bucket of water on him for knocking her out right before she planned to put down Ogre and end the fight.
 
Later on, it was stated by Andre that Sera gives a fair amount of leniency to Ovis, as he noted that if it had been anyone but Augus and Ovis who had interrupted her fight like that, even in one of the outbuildings of the village he and Ogre would be in the blast radius of her fury.[10].
 
A loyal knight pledged to Sera, Andre was originally a member of a vassal house to Sera's. Sera has shown to trust him implicitly to act as her messenger. She had a friendly relationship with Andre prior to the events of the Flower Civil War, as Andre was not only engaged to Sera's sister but also had a friendly rivalry with Sera's fiance at the time, Clarent Morgan. During the war Sera showed her own loyalty to her people back when she raced to save Andre's house after Sera's sister betrayed them all. She was shown embracing Andre after the loss of his entire family in the ambush t
