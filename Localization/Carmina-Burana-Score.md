Weird thing is, a whole bunch of people seem to remember Oh Fortuna being used, including myself. In fact i've listened to bits of the Goldsmith score and can't figure out for the life of me how i'd mistake that for Oh Fortuna.

It does also seem to be quite a popular misconception, i tried googling around and there's nothing definitive linking The Omen with Carmina Burana, but quite a few people seem to think of Oh Fortuna as 'the Omen music'.
 
So has the film always had this score? We're wondering now if maybe there's been some dispute about the rights to the soundtrack? Or maybe some TV station rescored bits for some reason? It's kind of weird and confusing...
 
The Omen has never used Oh Fortuna as far i know, it has always had its own score or original soundtrack (he even won an Oscar award for this music). i have the dvd and Goldsmith explain a lot of great details about the composition.
 
I think the confusion comes from the use of choirs and the powerful orchestration, but in my opinion they are a little different. I think carmina Burana is more in the epic line of some Poledouris' choir themes (Conan), or maybe with Nobuo Uematsu
