At the time the clue was in the cost of the product, the cost reflected by the processing power. So being the most expensive item the television was regarded as having the superior upscaling ? To that end I never activate the upscaling on the Blu-ray player and leave it to the television.

You will not, annoyingly, find this in either of the manuals you will find at first online on the Sony site for the BDP-S6700 (12 and 13), but if you choose 'view all manuals' there and download the 2.98Mb one, you will get version 11, which does explain these settings
 
[Auto1]: Outputs 2K (1920 1080) video signals during video playback and 4K video signals during photo play when connecting to a Sony 4K-compatible equipment. Outputs 4K video signals during playback of 24p video contents in BD ROMs/DVD ROMs/Data content/ Network content or photo play when connecting to a non-Sony 4K-compatible equipment. This setting does not work for 3D video image playback.
 
[Auto2]: Automatically outputs 4K/24p video signals when you connect a 4K/24p -compatible equipment and make the appropriate settings in [BD- ROM 24p Output], [DVD-ROM 24p Output], [Data content 24p Output] or [Network content 24p Output] and also outputs 4K/24p photo images when you play 2D photo files.
 
The logic of Auto 1, presumably, is that Sony are not going to sell an upscaling BluRay player which, by default, lets somebody else's kit do the upscaling, but that they are actually keen to cede the upscaling to any of their own TVs.
 
I had to put my BDP-6500 on Auto 2 to check that my Yamaha soundbar was doing the 4K passthrough that it claimed, when using a Sony Android TV; apart from that consideration, any difference on the TV between Auto 1 and Auto 2 upscaling was undetectable.

As is any difference between Off and Auto 1/2 when using the Samsung TV we now have there, though I leave the BluRay on Auto 2 so as to get my money's worth. Actually, there is no point in a BluRay player upscaling, unless you (or Sony!) think it can upscale better than your TV, but you need the BDP-S6700 over its lesser, or older, brethren for the extra goodies like Bluetooth, maybe
 
So here's something I've been wondering. I have a few older videos stored away from my attempt at being a Youtube star about 10+ years ago. They were shot in 720p60, and I'd love to see what they'd look like upscaled to 1440p or 4K.
 
GPU upscaling refers to the process of using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to increase the resolution of a video or image. This can be done through various algorithms and techniques, such as super-resolution or neural network-based methods.
 
If you're looking for an application that supports upscaling videos using AMD GPUs, you can consider using a popular video editing software called Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe Premiere Pro provides GPU-accelerated video processing and supports AMD GPUs for tasks like video upscaling.
 
With Adobe Premiere Pro, you can import your older videos and apply upscaling effects to increase their resolution to 1440p or 4K. The GPU acceleration provided by AMD GPUs can significantly speed up the upscaling process and improve overall performance.
 
It's great that you're looking to upscale your older videos to higher resolutions like 1440p or 4K for a better viewing experience. While VLC Player and Edge have indeed introduced GPU-accelerated upscaling features, there are other specialized video editing applications that might better suit your needs, especially if you're using AMD GPUs.
 
One popular choice for upscaling videos with AMD GPU support is DaVinci Resolve. It offers robust upscaling options and can take advantage of the GPU's power for efficient processing. Alternatively, if you're looking for a more mobile-friendly solution, you can explore mobile video editing apps like CapCut and Kinemaster, both of which have their own upscaling capabilities. However, be aware that mobile apps may have limitations compared to desktop software.
 
Give one of these options a try, and you'll likely achieve the video quality you're aiming for. Remember to check the specific GPU requirements and features in the software to ensure compatibility with your AMD GPU.
 
If you're looking to upscale your older videos using an AMD GPU, you might want to consider using a program like "AMD Radeon Software" or "AMD Adrenalin." These software packages often include features for enhancing video quality, including upscaling. While I can't provide a step-by-step guide, you can explore their settings and look for options related to video enhancement and upscaling to 1440p or 4K. Additionally, you may want to check for any third-party video editing software that specifically supports AMD GPUs for upscaling.
 
It's fantastic that you want to improve the watching experience by upgrading your older videos to higher resolutions like 1440p or 4K. Although GPU-accelerated upscaling functions have been added to VLC Player and Edge, if you're utilizing AMD GPUs, there are other specialist video editing apps that might be more suitable for your needs.
 
DaVinci Resolve is a well-liked option for upscaling videos with AMD GPU support. It provides a wide range of upscaling choices and can leverage the GPU's processing capabilities for effective results. As an alternative, you might investigate mobile video editing programs like CapCut vs Kinemaster, both of which contain upscaling features, if you're searching for a more portable solution. However, keep in mind that, in comparison to desktop software, mobile apps could have certain limitations.
 
There is a lot to unpack and a lot of value in this review. Unfortunately, it has been my experience that HQPlayer has the least to add to the Chord set of DACs because they effectively limit upscaling to PCM input and the TT Scaler is optimized for that. For those with ESS ES9038PRO or AKM AK4490 chipset-based DACs or R-2-R ladder Dacs (Holo Audio or Denafrips) using HQPlayer to upsample to DSD256 or DSD512 seems to offer a greater level of improvement than is possible using it to upsample PCM for Chord. That then begs the question: Is there a HQPlayer/DSD512 non Chord DAC combo that sounds as good or better tban the TTScaler/Dave combination at a similar price?
 
A Chord TT Scaler/Dave versus Denafrips Terminator II + Gaia + HQPlayer comparison would be pretty interesting. My guess is that the Gaia might add some of the timbre accuracy you noticed in your Terminator review and the right HQP filter at DSD512 would add even more delicacy.
 
The DC4 has been mentioned. I have the Sean Jacobs DC4 power supply with my Dave and prior to that I had the DC3. As you say, there are crazy improvements in transparency, depth and texture by adding the DC4 but I heard no loss of warmth. In fact to my ears I hear less harshness. I would never have described Dave as being harsh until I swopped back to the stock Dave after using the DC4 powered Dave. When I was assessing the DC4 effectiveness with the Dave I was lucky at that time because I had a second stock Dave so I could do more or less instant switching between them. The price was steep when I bought my DC4 (I had the first production DC4 that Sean made) and it is steeper now but everyone who has bought a DC4 even at the current price has come back to me and thanked me for suggesting the stunning upgrade to Dave.
 
Finaly, there have not been any product announcements from Chord for a long time, probably due to Covid. To my eyes there is a glaring gap in the line up previously occupied by the Blu Mk2. It would not surprise me to see a Choral range Mscaler to compliment the Dave. If so I am guessing that will far outstrip the current Hugo Mscaler and set the bar even higher for rival upscaling products.
 
However, using HQPlayer with OpticalRendu with the PC connected to the network via optical as well as the OpticalRendu it was a far closer battle. I found I stayed on NS9 with Sinc-M at full upscaling. Imaging and tonal detail was superb with a lot of body. Via OR, I found the LNS15 to be too heavy, thick.
 
SRC-DX dual BNC into a TT2/ Dave gets you M-Scaler level (or arguably better) performance as you bypass the relatively noisier Amanero USB connection and take advantage of the ideal dual BNC connection. Suddenly the M-Scaler no longer has monopoly on the use of dual BNC in Chord DACs.
 
Thank you for this great review! Trying some of your recommended settings already. Maybe worth to not, when you use e.g. in Roon a playlist or so, you do not have this 30 seconds between tracks. Tracks are prepared in the background. Anyway thank you agin ?
 
How is FLAC crap? Convert a WAV file to FLAC and then back to WAV and the resulted WAV file will have the same checksum as the original WAV. FLAC is just a container, with the option of lossless compression.
 
Jay, HQPlayer 4 Embedded PCM setting have 1x filter and Nx Filter with Dither, the combo you given has only one filter and one dither, should the filter be the same for both 1x and Nx? and what about SDM only has 1x oversampling and Nx oversampling without dither, what is your reference for the SDM? thanks.
 
What about hardware implementation at source level, tonal differences might be due to outputting from the M-Scaler digital outs (most likely very well designed) and whatever digital source component you used with HQPlayer.
 
Have tried them and when the rig is silent enough, there will be no need for long sessions to establish that HQPe have the potential of the utmost silence and correction of todays most torture music worshipping of the limiter and compressor instead of skilled mix and gentle mastering. But the ethernet network
