But more than 50 years ago, Burt Bacharach and Hal David's whimsical ditty featured prominently in Paul Newman and Robert Redford's classic "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which premiered on Sept. 23, 1969.
 
History has proven it was a good thing that director George Roy Hill insisted on keeping the song. "Raindrops" would turn into a No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit, earning Bacharach and David an Oscar in 1970. Bacharach earned another Oscar for his film score (two of the four Academy Awards "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" would take home).

Bacharach understood the misgivings. After all, the single recorded by B.J. Thomas, who died in 2021 at 78, included curious lyrics like: "Raindrops are falling on my head / And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed / Nothing seems to fit."
 
Inspiration struck the composer while watching the scene of Newman's charming outlaw Butch Cassidy showing off his new bicycle to Sundance's girlfriend Etta Place (Katharine Ross) during a low-key moment in their outlaw existence.
 
"As Butch was riding, it was the way he looked. I kept hearing melodically what it sounded like with the ukulele and the bicycle, and it was all very simple," Bacharach said. "I put in these dummy lyrics into the melody I was writing, I knew it made no sense."
 
The songwriter said he never discussed the issue with Redford. But the film's star, a founder of Sundance Film Festival, has seen the light. Today, the song still works from the standpoint of nostalgia. All these years later, it still has resonance," Redford says.
