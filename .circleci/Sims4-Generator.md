Perhance is a platform that allows you to create your own custom random generators. You could use it to create your own random text generator for a tabletop RPG, or to make your own random name generator, or to simply create a generator which selects a random item from your list with different weights. You can also save your generator so it has a permalink that you can share with your friends.

Perchance is based around creating lists which reference other lists. You can adjust the odds of items in each list so that when you randomly select an item from that list, they all have the likelihoods that you've specified. If you'd like to learn how to make a random text generator with Perchance, you should check out the tutorial. It explains all the basic features of the Perchance engine and should get you up and running in only 10 or 20 minutes. Perchance has many powerful features that you don't need to learn from the start, but can learn later if you want to create particularly complex generators.
 
I created Perchance because most people are still creating random generators in excel. Those work all right, but excel and other spreadsheets aren't really made for that purpose, so there's a lot to be desired in terms of functionality and ease of use. Whatever you're using it for, I hope you find Perchance useful! You might like to check out our community forum where you can ask questions and share your random generator creations.

if you click the button below, it will load a list of older versions of your generator so you can download them in case you accidentally deleted your code, or there was a system error. copies of your generator code are also backed-up to your local browser storage, so if your computer ever crashes and you hadn\'t saved in a while, you\'ll be able to come here to recover your data.

**"I feel like i just been scammed by the game. I was collecting sim bucks for what feels like forever, because i wanted to purchase the Vu's Random Generator. I thought it was gonna generate Vu items like the name suggests, only to find out i actually spent 2000 sim bucks on a simple commercial store that just changes randomly. I didn't know that i was purchasing tha since the building didn't have a description, i could only guess by the name that its a Vu item generator (what else could it possibly be?) which it wasn't.**
 
It is quite expensive, but if you don't manage to return it, it can still be helpful for Contest of Mayors and earning Simoleons, as well as extra productions. The only buildings that generate Vu items are Maxis Manor and Maxis HQ (which was a limited-time building).
 
The generator actually sounds useful ,however you need the Tower to get it and I am a pacifist mayor (except for swatting the squid monsters). When my husband and I first played the original Simcity ,I would build a city and he was the one who trashed it with disasters.

What happens when the bug occurs? So, every 24 to 48 hours in game I have my generators OR the spot my generators were in catch on fire. At first they were running fine at one location on my roof, but I moved them to be on the other side after a few days of playing on the lot. That night they (2 of them) caught on fire. I figured I needed to upgrade generators or there was a chance of them catching on fire. So, I bought one new. Placed it in the same spot but did not use it at all. I wanted to upgrade it. about 2 nights later it catches on fire again. I get rid of it and put nothing in its place not wanting to worry about it right now. The very next night... a empty spot on my grass roof catches on fire where my generators once were. Spontaneous Combustion. There is nothing there... I put out the fire. Save game and quit - not wanting to play the cursed save file for a while.
What do you expect to see? I expect spontaneous combustion not to happen. I understand generators catching on fire. Even ones not being used....?! (still think that might be a bug too...), but empty roof should not just catch on fire. Seriously hoping fire fighters weren't added to game because of spontaneous combustion of grass roofs...

I thought i was going insane. I had this happen to me the other night. So in my current game I have a little "utility" building out in the yard, where i have power and water generators. One night two of them caught on fire, put fire out and deleted the burnt ones. Didn't replace them as my sim didn't have enough money to. Then literally a few minutes later a fire started where the generators were, but there was nothing there. Like the OP states, the fires just started on nothing! kept putting them out but it kept starting back up. I saved the game, and quit. Repaired my game and played it the next day. I haven't had it happen since. So it makes me think that its some sort of bug that is only triggered once there is a fire, and stops after you quit the game/or repair? Just my thought from my experience.

What expansions, game packs, and stuff packs do you have installed? All except for machine
Steps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Put power generator in apartment building turn on power generator and wait for electric company to turn off power, power is shut off on lot despite generator running, if generator is running power should still remain on as long as generator is running. 
What happens when the bug occurs? same as above.
What do you expect to see? when power company turns off power and water, lots with internal power generators and water makers should keep power on as long as the generators or water makers are running. Power company should not be able to shut down a internal source of power and water.
Have you installed any customization with the game, e.g. Custom Content or Mods? Not now. I've removed them.

Edit: I went to the other lot in Oasis Springs and added the power and water generator, it works when power is off for conservation day, but does not work when bills are due, which I don't get if you have power and water generating abilities and you put it to store, you should be able to keep the stored energy and water and use it even if bills are overdue. Lots that get the water and electricity disconnected should operate as off the grid lots until bills are paid. Both Green and Industry power and water generators, should override the power and water shutoff as your getting the power and water locally.
 
Edit: I checked the green energy ones too same problem at least with the power, well, couldn't check the water one as there was no rain. However, if you have it as store in the bill area that is your free energy or water to use no matter if your bills are owed or not.
 
No I am talking about regular lots as when they shut off the electricity and water for failure to pay your bills when you have the power and water settings as store, with water and power generators failure to pay your bill shouldn't limit the power and water you collect internally. Regular lots if you don't pay your bill function like "off grid lots", and when you have everything on store, and power and water generators on failure to pay bills shuts off water and electivity despite having a internal power and water source.
 
Its most likely the same problem as internal power sources should generator power reserves especially if you choose store as your not selling any unused power or water to the utility company. Ok say like you have a mothly bill of 232 dollars in real and you store power on a disconnected generator, that uses gas. The power company can't tell you that you can't hook up your house to a power generator. Your get power that is not counted by the company because its internal to the lot. I expect it to work the same way in the Sims 4. You generate power on lot and set everything in the bills section to store, when 24 hours after bills arrive they shutoff your power, and water even if the water and power generators are running.
