Earthlink is one of the most expansive internet service providers in the U.S., offering fiber, DSL, and fixed wireless plans in all 50 states. Earthlink rents space on other internet provider networks instead of building its own infrastructure, allowing the provider to focus more on the customer experience.
 
CenturyLink offers two types of internet plans: DSL and fiber. Its DSL is more widely available than its fiber plans, but if you are lucky enough to have fiber in your area, you can get gigabit internet for $75 a month. CenturyLink only has one fiber plan and lacks any multi-gig fiber plans.
 
With satellite internet, you often pay higher prices for slower speeds. Hughesnet offers the most affordable satellite internet option and a straightforward pricing structure that makes it easy to choose a plan or purchase additional data. All Hughesnet plans offer the same amount of speed. Where they differ is how much data comes with each plan.
 
Understanding how much speed you need for your household is another important consideration. Plans with download speeds of about 100Mbps are good for small households, but you may need more bandwidth for a bigger home. Take our quick speeds needs quiz to find out what speed will be right for you.
 
As you decide, keep an eye out for introductory prices, required contracts, and extra fees. Some providers have incredible deals on internet plans but after a year, monthly prices may double. Always read the fine print.

Fiber internet sends LED or laser pulses through glass fibers that translate into data. Fiber is the best internet on the market today, capable of speeds up to 10,000 Mbps But its availability remains limited because fiber-to-the-home requires a new infrastructure in your neighborhood versus using existing cable and telephone lines.
 
Fixed-wireless brings internet service to your home using the same wireless technologies used by mobile devices. This internet type is split into 5G and 4G providers. We recommend you choose a 5G provider (like T-mobile or Verizon) as the service will be faster and more reliable than 4G fixed wireless internet service.

ACP enrolled households are strongly encouraged to carefully review written notices from their internet company and from the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), the ACP administrator, about the end of the ACP.
 
The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) was a federal program that offered eligible households a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service and up to $75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal Lands. Eligible households could also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 toward the purchase of a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating internet companies if the household contributed more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price.
 
The ACP launched in December 2021 and as of February 8, 2024, over 23 million households relied on the program to access affordable internet service before the $14.2 billion in funding Congress made available ran out.
 
Getting Error code 202 when trying to use apps or do anything on my tv via wifi.. The strange thing is I get "connected to the internet" via wifi, but then trying to use Netflix, hulu, etc...it doesn't work...digging deeper I found that I "cannot connect to smart hub" because there is an "ip blocking the service. error code 202." Everything works fine when I hard wire a lan cable...but that's not practical for my setup.
 
This is what worked for me. Something about disconnecting every piece of equipment one by one and then powering back on one by one allowed the connections to be reestablished. Hope I can help someone else with these steps.
 
I have exactly the same problem as the "brandofosho". In my case, I have a smartv model QE55Q70TAT and the problem happened today. Unexpectedly. I have had this TV for 5 months and I have never had this problem.
I have already taken the same steps, presented by MihailEd and Brandsho. Unfortunately, to no avail.
From November until today, Bransho, did you solve the problem? tell me how?
Thanks
 
Does anyone else using the T mobile Home Internet model KVD21 have this happen to them? My internet worked great for the first month, and about 2 days ago or so the internet just drops randomly and won't reconnect and will give me error codes Wan005 and Wan002 until I factory reset it. Turning it off and on again multiple times doesn't fix the error either. And when I do factory reset it, whenever it goes to reboot it gets stuck in a cycle where it keeps restarting over and over until randomly it finally reboots after unplugging and plugging it back in multiple times. This is super frustrating as you could probably imagine and I have no idea why out of nowhere it started doing this. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, if it continues I guess I will try to see about getting a replacement unit. Thanks for any input or thoughts on what could be the issue!
 
Reseating it never worked for me, I haven't had the issue since yesterday I've put a fan underneath the unit and it seems to have mitigated the issue. My best guess is it's an overheating problem because after the unit is unplugged for 5 or so minutes the errors go away
 
Try putting a fan or something near it to keep it cool. To get the errors to go away I had to factory reset using the little pinhole button on the back. You could try unplugging it for a while and letting it cool down and plugging it back in
 
I have the same issue. Got the Arcadyan modem. Worked great for about a month then suddely stopped working. Box connects to the towers (I see the freq it connects on 4G and 5G on the app) but zero internet. On the modem itself, the error Wan002 appears. Rebooted multiple times with no luck.
 
I have two home internet accounts and I'm wondering if it's a device issue. The grey cylinder one works fine and the black box one keeps having the issue this thread is about. The app won't even connect to it anymore even being on the wifi of the router. It's not an internet issue for me as the TV and phone connect just fine. But if I try to use the app or ethernet to a mesh wifi it stops working. If I plug other ethernet devices they connect to the internet. The Indian tech support is not helpful. And the app did not do an upgrade of firmware.
 
Uninstalling and reinstalling the app and doing the setup again for the device connects the app but still no ethernet port for my mesh wifi but other ethernet devices connect just fine. Mesh being deco m5 which works fine with the grey cylinder home internet.
 
I re-seated the SIM card by removing it and putting it back in the same way, but not closing the little rubberized flap afterwards. I suspect pressure from the flap may be pushing the SIM card slightly away from the ideal electrical contact position.
 
To fix error code WAN002, contact T-Mobile tech support and ask them to reset the SIM card found on the router. You will have to remove it and read those tiny numbers to them; it only takes a few minutes and that is it, problem fixed.
 
I should've stayed away after reading the reviews. Now I regret getting T-Mobile home internet service. Phone service is fine but home internet is horrible. Constant buffering (frozen now as Im typing this), bandwidth is low messages, "no internet connection" message even though the router shows 4 Bars with "your connection is very good" message. Most recently I've been ge
