Telugu Language Day is celebrated on birthday of Gidugu Venkata Ramamoorty, a prominent Telugu writer, one of the earliest linguists and social visionary during the British rule. He is known for advocating the use of a language, comprehensive to the common man, and opposed the use of scholar language.

Spoken Telugu was different from written Telugu, that is taught at schools. Learning written Telugu didn't give necessary skills for understanding or effective communication in everyday life. Due to Ramamoorty's attempts, spoken Telugu was standardized and accepted by pundits. Nowadays cultivated modern Telugu is the medium of instruction, examination and even thesis writing.
 
Different events and activities are organized to celebrate Telugu Language Day. Students read poems and stories in Telugu. Everyone has an opportunity to visit an exhibition, dedicated to this language.
