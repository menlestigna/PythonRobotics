A file with a .dms extension is a file that has been downloaded and renamed by the Apple Safari web browser or the Apple Mail email client. It contains the contents of a file that did not have a file extension or was erroneously renamed when downloaded. The .dms extension is a result of a bug in Safari and Mail.

To open a DMS file, rename the .dms extension with the appropriate extension for the file type. For example, if you know you downloaded an .XLSX file that was renamed with the .dms extension, click on the extension to highlight it and change it back to .xlsx. Then, you can open the file with a program that supports XLSX files.
 
Hey, I too have faced your problem today when the Lab where I gave my blood for testing sent me the reports as a .dms file! Other applications such as Unarchiver, MaxUAE suggests in other like posts were not able to open the file. I then did this: clicked on the link to the reports in MAIL! The link opened the document in Safari and I was able to view the results only but there seem to be no provision for me to save the reports to my computer. Hope this helps.
 
Soon after writing the above, I accessed the document in Safari and clicked on the share ikon at the top right and chose to share the document to my NOTES. When I opened my NOTES, the document was not there but only the link was there. Clicking on the link led to the opening of the document in Safari.
 
Mail is All Sorts of Bad, when copying files around. Mail servers can do all sorts of shenanigans with attachments, contents, sizes and the rest of filing and filtering and storing. Please don't use Mail as a file distribution mechanism. It's really designed and built for mail. Not for shipping around parcels.
 
i also sent it to myself in an email. The one bw jpg opened but the color images cant be opened. These were edited in PS. When i went to the work computer that file in the finder was greyed out . Am i being taken for a Ransom ride?

I think I figured it out -MAYBE...The image was edited in Photoshop as usual. I saved the file as a jpg in the original folder. Somewhere I read if a file is not saved with an extention, safari adds .dms?
 
MrH, This is what I did initially because I couldnt find my Lacie HD to just transfer the one file upstairs. I dragged and dropped and then I saw that for the color file but not for the same BW file. So I emailed it to myself and opened it upstairs and it occurred down here...
 
Mail servers can do weird stuff with mail, as they're often configured to block spam and malware, to block attempts to DoS folks by shipping them large files, and these among other site-specific and server-specific requirements.
 
Various homes with lots of computers and many organizations will end up with network-attached storage boxes ("NAS"), and which the local systems can access and can use to share files and data. Or with installing local cloud-hosting approaches, such as OwnCloud or NextCloud.
 
A DMS file is a compressed Amiga disk image created using Amiga's Disk Masher System (DMS). It contains data intended for use with an Amiga computer. DMS files were originally used to transfer data among Amiga users via physical floppy disks, but are now most often used to share Amiga games, programs, and other files online, for use with Amiga emulators such as Amiga Forever.
 
The Amiga was created by Commodore International and was one of the earliest PCs to support advanced graphics, sound, and video. Its superior multimedia capabilities made it quite popular among gamers, music enthusiasts, video producers, and other creatives. However, as other companies released computers and game consoles that matched or surpassed the Amiga's capabilities, the Amiga faded from the PC market.
 
Many modern decompression programs do not support the DMS format, so you might have to download a program such as The Unarchiver (Mac) or WinFellow (Windows) if you want to view the files contained within a DMS archive.
 
A DMS file may also be a script file (i.e. "connect.dms") run by Dream Seeker, a client for playing online games. It was created by Dream Maker, part of the BYOND (Build Your Own Net Dream) suite of programs.
 
A DMS file may also be a file that has been downloaded and renamed by the Apple Safari web browser or the Apple Mail email client. It contains the contents of a file that did not have a file extension or was erroneously renamed when downloaded. The .dms extension is a result of a bug in Safari and Mail.
 
You most likely will encounter this type of DMS file only if you download a file that does not have a file extension in macOS with Safari or Mail. In some cases, Safari or Mail may also replace a valid extension with .dms or may append the .dms extension onto a file extension. For example, sample.pdf may become sample.dms or sample.pdf.dms when downloaded with Safari or Mail.
 
The bug is specific to Macs and has been reported across multiple versions of Mac operating systems, with some issues dating back to the early 2000s. While Safari and Mail are the typical perpetrators, the .dms renaming may also occur with other web browsers and programs.
 
A DMS file may also be a MIDI sequence created by Takabo Soft Domino, a free MIDI music editor. It contains binary data that defines the sequence's tracks, notes, timing, key signature, and metadata. DMS files are similar to .SMF and .MIDI files, except they can be opened only with Domino.
 
Domino allows amateur composers to create digital music by placing notes upon a piano roll. Each song a composer creates in Domino can consist of up to 16 tracks, allowing composers to create complex, multi-track songs. Composers can also adjust their songs' time and key signature, and they can add lyrics, comments, and cue points.
 
By default, Domino saves the songs that composers create as DMS files. From within Domino, composers can send the songs their DMS files contain to a MIDI device, or they can export the songs in the Standard MIDI (.SMF) format, for use with other MIDI programs and devices.

A file with the DMS file extension is most likely a Disk Masher Image file. Disk Masher is a program used to create compressed disk image files for backing up disks for Amiga computers. The DMS file was used to archive disk images on floppy disks. However, DMS files may be opened with an Amiga emulator, such as the Cloanto Amiga Forever program or the WinFellow Amiga emulator.

I have a stacked pair of some old x460's which are at code 16.2.2.4. I'm trying to upgrade them to summitX-16.2.5.4-patch1-29 and when I download the file, it does not save it with an xos extension. Instead it uses a dms file extension (i.e. summitX-16.2.5.4-patch1-29.dms). When I select it in the download menu, it shows the file with an xos extension. When I run an md5 or sha256 hash, it matches and passes. I know there is no file corruption.
 
Are you having problems opening a DMS file or are you simply curious about its contents? We're here to explain the properties of these files and provide you with software that can open or handle your DMS files.
 
While Disk Masher System Compressed Disk Image is a popular type of DMS-file, we know of 2 different uses of the .DMS file extension.Different software may use files with the *same extension* for different types of data.
 
These apps are known to open certain types of DMS files. Remember, different programs may use DMS files for different purposes, so you may need to try out a few of them to be able to open your specific file.
 
Not sure exactly what type of file you are trying to open? Try our new File Analyzer. It is a free tool that can identify more than 11,000 different kinds of files - most likely yours too! It will help you find software that can handle your specific type of file. Download File Analyzer here.
 
? Furthermore, this custom .DMS variation may also be based on the file structure that has been formerly downloaded and renamed by the Apple Mail email client or Apple Safari web-browser. Accurately, this .DMS hierarchy is composed of a file definition that was erroneously renamed or did not have an original file format marker when downloaded. The .DMS extension label stands out as a result of a bug in Mail or Safari. Most likely, you would gain a chance to encounter this appropriate category of .DMS entity only if you manage to download the file that does not own a proper file extension in macOS architecture with Mail or Safari. In particular circumstances, Mail or Safari can make a decision to replace a valid extension tag with the .DMS label or may append the .DMS marker entitlement to already existing format entitlement. This relevant bug is specific to macOS shells and has been reported across multiple editions of Mac operating systems, with some certain issues dating back to early 2000s. While Mail and Safari remain the primary perpetrators, the .DMS renaming procedure may also occur with other software toolkits and web-navigators.
