 Legionary posted 07 June 2005 15:24 EDT (US) 3 / 5 You aren't supposed to actually put the city name in the . So, for example, if you're putting it in Carthage, it would look like:add\_population Carthage 4000See our cheat page next time. **We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.** lars573 
 Legionary posted 07 June 2005 18:19 EDT (US) 4 / 5 Also something that isn't mentioned in the cheat page is that Halicarnassus won't accept instant build or population cheats, no how no way. Also to use the population cheat on a city like Campus Sakae or Lepcius Magna you have to use this form, add\_population Lepcius\_Magna 4000. Capitols letters matter.

All trainers made for EE2 in ver 1.2 and AOS in ver 1.0 should work fine with Unofficial Patch 1.5, however, you need to kill the Launcher process which works in the background in order to use them. Using trainers in Multiplayer games will result in Out of Sync error. If somebody abuses OOS, the Ministry of Game Affairs might ban the player by the unique ID from the Multiplayer services.
 
Using trainers, even in Single Player games is DANGEROUS and NOT RECOMMENDED! Those programs are usually virused! Please use the built-in game cheats instead (press the ENTER key to show the chat window):

To use cheats in Multiplayer games, the option "Enable Cheats" must be checked before game start. This option is available on the set-up screen under "Advanced" tab. Unfortunately and fortunately only two cheats work in Multiplayer games: **toggle fog** and **play god**.
 
With Unofficial Patch 1.5 you can use the built-in **unlimited population** hack called "the Tree of Death". To build the tree, produce the "Gardener" in the "City Center", then select the Gardener and under "UP1.5 Constructions" button select and place the "Tree of Death". To prevent abuses in Multiplayer games - this tree costs a lot of resources and technology points. To get enough resources and technology points simply spam "loot" and "give tech" cheats. Cheats and the Tree of Death is everything you need. Trainers with additional features don't exist, so it's simply pointless and dangerous to search for them.
 
One clear issue is that Riftborn should have inverted pop slots so they gain more slots on sterile. This could be accomplished by just adding to sterile and subtracting from fertile on the Biophobic trait.
 
I think the idea is that Riftborn don't have terribly high populations, as the industry cost for new pops is supposed to make building a great many of them offputting. In principle, this would make specialised lava/ice worlds more appealing. In practice, minor pops are quite happy living on sterile worlds in their empire, and building Riftborn pops in a high industry system and shipping them out works fine.
 
Reducing food and population growth in general would benefit lower population worlds, by the way: it's no good having a Terran planet you can't fill. Given that we know food is being looked at, I'd encourage anyone worried about how powerful Tier 0 worlds are due to their population sizes to wait and see what lower growth does to the balance. I expect that it moves even more toward the idea you terraform your core, high population worlds - while leaving empty, frontier worlds until they have a population large enough to make it worth it.
 
I would say no to Riftborn pop increasing for harsher worlds. Terraforming to Tier 0 planets removes many bonuses from improvements for the other factions (cold tags for science, hot for industry) thus making them a bit balanced. With these improvement + improved pops, RB would be broken (they already are a strong faction imo). 

As for Biofuel reactor, The tech is pretty late and only kicks in once you go through the tedious terraforming process (that itself being unlocked mid-late game as a research + industry to do so in a system). I would be happy to leave it as it is. It does sound a little unbalanced when you assume you have max pop planet with biofuel unlocked as you would do in a statistical analysis, but getting there takes long. Unless entire food system is reworked, I would be happy to leave it where it is.
 
Please NO to riftborn increased population slots. This is already balanced by there populations production levels... The riftborn don't need any help with population or industry, especially if your using a naked world to send riftborn pops to your main systems. The riftborn POP if increased backwards like the number of pop slots on a LAVA equivelent to the slots on a Terran world for say the lumeris would make them GROSSLY OP, they are already one of the strongest on fast without question.
 
Concerning pop slots for Riftborn: A simple solution to avoid over-complication could be to tie extra population slots on sterile (or even non-fertile) to a tech (or multiple techs). Only researchable for Riftborn of course. However this would not include a reduction for fertile planets.
 
I do not think that new player friendliness should be cause for concern with an 'advanced' faction like Riftborn, and I may be wrong, but simply explaining that 'you prefer sterile worlds and can have more pops there' should not be a stretch.
 
I suppose the 'new player' aspect is an issue. I don't know about physical space; I assumed the 'space' issue on planets was just related to physical infrastructure needed to provide places to live i.e. habitable areas. One assumes the Riftborn would find more space habitable than non-Riftborn, given their rather unique composition.
 
I do agree the Biophobic trait should be a racial trait though (maybe even added to more races too, like Epistis and Deuvians), it would at least make managing unhappiness with RB empires a bit of a problem, as opposed to the non-issue it currently is.

I may like the RB the most out of all the ES2 races, yet I don't think Amplitude devs should go for this. Imho, all Empires should get the same amount of pops (roughly and bar Vods) on the same type of planets, firstly, because it would be hard to explain that to new players, it's already pretty confusing that the tree only allows you to terraform in a reversed way, but it also feels unnatural, RB like sterile planets the most but for example, in Lava and Toxic planets it's not like they have more space to put their robotic shells than the rest of the Races. Also it wouldn't adress the issue of Lava being worse than Ash for other races.

Hey, there. Today I wanted to make a lenghty post regarding the balance of the different planets, including their yields and their modifiers.

First of all, if you're a regular player, you probably noticed how most planets are inferior regarding their yields in late game to Tier 0 planets, aka Atoll, Ocean, Terran and Forest. That comes from a simple thing : A vast majority of System improvements and Governor skills take effect on the number of population, and because Tier 0 planets have the most population slots (cf 1st figure) they end up being superior in all FIDSI and Happiness production.
 
Now, you could retort this isn't so bad and that it's fine to have the T0 planets be the end-game goal of Terraformation, but the problem with this is that it conflicts with 2 philosophies of the game:
 
In the above calc (link here if you want to take a look at how I calculate those), I put all the improvements scaling on population (as well as most of the additive bonus) for industry and Food (Dust, Science and Influence aren't complete because I only wanted to make a point about Ash/Lava/Desert). The orange column represents the industry output at max population. It is clear that Desert is better than Ash at Industry, which in turn is better than Lava, this being counter intuitive and conflicting with the seemingly "higher tier is more specialized" philosophy of the game. The differences can become even worse if you manage to stack Void stones in your system upgrades (+4 industry/pop) and with the Governor skills which are not counted there.
