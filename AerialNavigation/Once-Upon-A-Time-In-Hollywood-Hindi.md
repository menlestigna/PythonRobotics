Announced in July 2017, it is the first Tarantino film not to involve Bob and Harvey Weinstein, as Tarantino ended his partnership with the brothers following the sexual abuse allegations against the latter. After a bidding war, the film was distributed by Sony Pictures, which met Tarantino's demands including final cut privilege. Pitt, DiCaprio, Robbie, Zo Bell, Kurt Russell, and others joined the cast between January and June 2018. Principal photography lasted from June through November around Los Angeles. *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* is the final film to feature Luke Perry, who died on March 4, 2019, and it is dedicated to his memory.
 
*Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 26, 2019, and in the United Kingdom on August 14. It grossed $374 million worldwide and received praise from critics for Tarantino's direction and screenplay, the performances (particularly from DiCaprio and Pitt), cinematography, soundtrack, sound design, costume design, and production values. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* one of the top-ten films of 2019. *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* was nominated for ten awards at the 92nd Academy Awards, winning two (Best Supporting Actor for Pitt and Best Production Design), and received numerous other accolades. A novelization, written by Tarantino in his debut as an author, was published on June 29, 2021.[5]

While fixing the TV antenna atop Dalton's roof, Booth notices a hippie man arriving at the Polanski residence. The man, Charles Manson, says he is looking for music producer Terry Melcher, who once lived there, but Tate's friend, Jay Sebring, turns him away.
 
Later, Booth gives a hitchhiker named "Pussycat" a ride to Spahn Ranch, a former Western film set where Booth did stunt work. Booth checks on octogenarian George Spahn, the ranch's nearly blind owner, making sure the hippies living there are not exploiting him. After discovering his car's tire has been punctured, Booth physically forces ranch hippie "Clem" to change it. "Tex" is summoned to deal with the situation, but Booth is driving away when he arrives.
 
Schwarz books Dalton to star in Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti Western *Nebraska Jim*. Booth accompanies Dalton to Italy for a six-month film shoot. Dalton films three additional movies there and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. Before returning to the US, Dalton tells Booth that he can no longer afford to pay him, which Booth amicably understands.
 
Returning to Los Angeles on August 8, 1969, Dalton and Booth go out drinking to commemorate their time together. Returning to Dalton's house, Booth smokes an LSD-laced cigarette and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton makes margaritas. Manson's followers Tex, "Sadie", "Katie", and "FlowerChild" arrive to murder the Tate house occupants. Hearing a car's loud muffler, an enraged Dalton furiously orders the group off the private street. They retreat, then start arguing until Katie suddenly realizes that they just encountered Rick Dalton, the group's childhood idol. Sadie rationalizes that the type of TV shows and movies that Dalton starred in "taught them to murder", therefore they should change their plan. The four decide to instead kill Dalton. FlowerChild has second thoughts and, pretending to fetch a weapon in the car, drives off, deserting them. Tex insists on carrying out the murderous plan, regardless.
 
Breaking into Dalton's house, they confront Booth. Tex aims his pistol at Booth, who, high on the LSD, happily chats with the intruders, unsure if they are real. He then recognizes them from Spahn Ranch. Booth signals his dog, Brandy, to attack Tex. Booth hurls a large dogfood can at Sadie, smashing her face, then signals Brandy to attack her. An enraged Capucci expertly punches Katie then runs off screaming. Tex tries attacking Booth with a knife, but Booth easily kills him with hand combat. Katie tackles Booth, stabbing his hip. Booth repeatedly slams Katie's face against the walls and fireplace mantle, killing her. As Brandy mauls Sadie, she fires Tex's gun and Booth falls to the floor unconscious.
 
Blinded and screeching, Sadie crashes through a plate glass window. She falls into the outdoor pool where Dalton has been relaxing, listening to music and oblivious to the indoor events. As Sadie thrashes in the water, screaming and wildly firing the pistol, Dalton retrieves a flamethrower, a functional prop retained from an earlier film. He incinerates Sadie in the pool. Police arrive as Booth regains consciousness. Dalton wants to accompany him to the hospital, but Booth insists he wait until the next day.
 
Quentin Tarantino portrays the director of Dalton's Red Apples cigarettes commercial[7] and the voice of *Bounty Law*.[8] Musician Toni Basil appears in the opening credits Pan Am scene dancing with Sharon Tate.[9] Margot Robbie also briefly reprises her role as Laura Cameron, a stewardess from the TV series *Pan Am*. Although her face is not seen, she makes and serves Dalton a cocktail on his flight home from Italy.[10]
 
The screenplay for *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* was developed slowly over several years by Tarantino. While he knew he wanted it to be titled *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, evoking the idea of a fairy tale, he publicly referred to the project as *Magnum opus*.[92] The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel,[92] which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between Rick Dalton and Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play.[93]
 
Tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work about 10 years previously while filming *Death Proof* with Kurt Russell who had been working with the same stunt double, John Casino, for several years. Even though there was only a small bit for Casino to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.[94][95] Tarantino stated, while Casino may have been a perfect double for Russell years earlier, when he met them, "this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together".[93]
 
Tarantino first created stuntman Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Next, he created actor Rick Dalton for whom Booth would stunt double. Tarantino decided to have them be Sharon Tate's next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, moving backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an Elmore Leonard-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by Richard Rush's 1980 film *The Stunt Man*, which used the scenes from the WWI movie they were making within the film as the action.[96] Further, to get his mind into Dalton, Tarantino wrote five episodes of the fictional television show *Bounty Law*, in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows.[16]
 
Tarantino kept the only copy of the third act of the script in a safe to prevent it from being prematurely released.[97] DiCaprio, Robbie, and Pitt were the only other people who read the entire script.[98][16] In an interview with Adam Sandler, Pitt revealed that the only other copy of the script was burned by Tarantino.[99]
 
On July 11, 2017, it was reported that Quentin Tarantino's next film would be about the Manson murders. Harvey and Bob Weinstein would be involved,[100] but it was not known whether The Weinstein Company would distribute the film, as Tarantino sought to cast before sending a package to studios.[*citation needed*] Tarantino approached Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence for roles and Margot Robbie was being considered for the role of Sharon Tate.[101]
 
After the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Tarantino cut ties with Weinstein and sought a new distributor, after having worked with Weinstein for his entire career. At this point, Leonardo DiCaprio was revealed to be among a short list of actors Tarantino was considering.[102] A short time later, reports circulated that studios were bidding for the film, and that David Heyman had joined as a producer, along with Tarantino and Shannon McIntosh.[103]
 
On November 11, 2017, Sony Pictures announced they would distribute the film, beating Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Annapurna Pictures and Lionsgate.[104] Tarantino's demands included a $95 million budget, final cut privilege, "extraordinary creative controls", 25% of first-dollar gross, and the stipulation that the rights revert to him after 10 to 20 years.[105]
 
In January 2018, DiCaprio signed on, taking a pay cut to collaborate with Tarantino again.[106][107] Al Pacino was being considered for a role.[108] On February 28, 2018, the film was titled *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, with Pi
