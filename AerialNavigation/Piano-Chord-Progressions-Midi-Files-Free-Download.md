MIDI packs are a set of files that DAWs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Cubase, Reaper, MPCs or Grooveboxes can read. They contain only note data, no sounds, so you DAWs or MPC can turn these notes data into sound with virtual instruments like synths and sample players. They can be used for many different genres and types of sound, from Dubstep to Trap or from Pop to Dark Ambient.
 
These chords packs make it easy for producers to drag and drop chords progressions, into their tracks in just a few seconds. This is why chord packs are so popular because they take away the need to program chord progressions from scratch, without knowing a lot about music theory, and how chords are built. A MIDI pack will allow you to try out new chords and progressions in seconds, progressions that you would have never thought of on your own.
 
MIDI data is very light and easy to manipulate, so a chord pack containing thousands of chords and progressions can be produced quite effortlessly for free. Not only the SHLD chord pack is free, but it is also a collaborative project, to which you can contribute easily.
 
What do you believe is the easiest way to quickly get a chord progression into that MIDI piano roll? Take it as a given it's for a user who knows music and chords, but not doesn't know how to play a piano keyboard.
 
Apps that I actually own that to come mind: Guide Track and Chord Bot will export MIDI files which you can open in a piano roll. You could program a chord progression into ChordPolyPad and then play it into a piano roll which give you some control over the rhythms of those chords. I think Cubasis has a chord pad feature too.
 
I like gadget's general workflow.ideally, I would like to do something like a step sequencer workflow within gadget.that is, lay down a chord. Then go to the next measure, and lay down a chord. Ideally, without having to worry about performing in real time.once I get a basic chord progression down, then I like to improvise over gadget in real time or slowed down time. Right now, fiddle waxed pro is the best way on the iPad for me to improvise over chords. And I will also improvise using my guitar if I move everything over to an audio DAW.

One trick you might not be aware of is that the Marseilles gadget gives you a button that produces basic chords from the keyboard in Gadget. They are triads, I think, but with some inversions going on.
 
Actually all gadgets have a chord function, Marseille is the only one which has a quick button access to it on the gadget. For the rest, you can turn on chords under the scale settings menu. Me personally, I don't like the way the chords are voiced, the note you hit is not the top note of the chord, which would be ideal for smooth voice leading. There's some interval added on top that I find annoying. That being said, it's super easy to record in from chord playing apps, soundprism, etc

i get why they voice them that way, so if you hit c you get a c chord, but it leads to bad voicing. If you hit c, c should be the top note, not the root, meaning that you could simply play a descending or ascending scale and get smooth voice leading, folks using the function won't care that it's not always a direct correlation between note name/chord name, it will just sound good.
 
For those who own Thesys, if you set the wanted progression of root notes in the first stripe (from up), and then set the chords in the third row of the performance stripe, you can the send MIDI to what  
ever app is able to receive it. I used it in Gadget, Cubasis and Auria and it works. Maybe not the easiest way to do it, but the choice of chords is insanely huge
 
If you guys want the sound come out of chord progression at the start of clock and be quantized well without you moving the midi data after recording to piano roll, I guess there is no easy way to do that!
 
You can do Fugue to Gadget relying on IAA on AUM playhead with Link, you can do that! But what else? Can you do without IAA with Link? Can you do without Modstep? Can you do beautiful chord progression purely on MIDI?
 
The solution hint for you is to use Midiflow app with Lemur (or without) with chord progression apps in between. Then you can have great alignment to Gadget or to any a Daw which can be driven by other playhead command by release the first note.
 
No matter what is in use for doing above mentioned, there must be a command to hold both both first notes and CC command to the playhead start from which sent by chord progression app to do so to MidiFlow. In this case, I refer to Lemur. Then you can have first note with playhead alignment.
 
It is very pitiful that iOS world has no such function for apps in a straight fashion. That is what I've seen from what you are doing and from my found out how this can be done. To speak clearly, the question is how do you align your StepPolyArp to Gadget? SPA can do progression part of chord progression. So then how this can be done is for your further research (no Modstep). I am not doing Gadget's owned chord and arp, they are vanilla taste, wishing you guys doing well.
 
I like ChordPolyPad, but imo the quickest and easiest method to punch out a lot of chords voiced exactly the way I want is to use chord memory thingy above the keyboard in Cubasis. If you know chords, learning how they look on a piano keyboard shoudn't be that big an exercise. Another method is to write them into Notion; I love its midi step-input, which is the only one I'm aware of on ios.
