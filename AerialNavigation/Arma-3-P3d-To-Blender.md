hi there, what about object tutorial? cus i've made one ww2 house in sketchup and facing issues while exporting. Even if its small model from blender im having problems with object builder or the oxygen
 
An experimental version of Armarig. Set up to allow the import of rtms, without complete loss of IK functionality. As stated it's experimental. So certainly not perfect. But where I can improve it, I will.

Also, how did you get the bvh bones to export properly. I've been animating weapons, this requires me to add in more armatures to animate parts on the weapon for accuracy. I have to manually delete these in blender so that the .bvh file will export properly. The problem? If I don't export them, the weapon bone will not be oriented properly (as you know) but if I just deselect the other bones (bolt, charging handle, etc) the weapon bone is still oriented wrong.
 
I understand there is a base skeleton upon which you can base your own armature. I also understand one needs to name the bones of this armature exactly like they are defined in the base skeleton (or model config?). Does that mean you can't simply create your own skeleton with different bones? Let's say I wanted to make a crazy spider with eight segmented legs, would that be possible?
 
The model.cfg lists these named selections and their hierarchical structure.As I understand it,most people here seem to refer to,this,or the named selections as the skeleton.Which is fine.Just a bit odd for me.
 
I don't have any examples in A2 to demonstrate.I'm still working on the old RV1 engine(Cold war assault).Anyway.The process isn't much different.For that engine I've already created non human entities.And characters with very different proportions and scaling to a default human.
 
I think I found the culprit. I'd generated a p3d file at some point in my development (one that wasn't working), but somewhere along the line my oxygen path got messed up in the settings and I wasn't generating new p3d's. :( In any case, I think I know what to look for now LOD wise and am confident there's nothing wrong with the toolbox. Thanks again for the help! :)
 
I install the script in blender like you explain in the readme, I open an object that I create with blender then I delete the camera and lamp object, I select the object (object mode), I press N and click on Arma Object Properties, i let all options on default. The path to O2 script is correct.
 
If the above doesn't work, then you have not correctly installed the addon, or your path is wrong. Make sure that the path to Oxygen 2 is correct, you should specify the path not the executable. If you have installed the Arma 3 tools via steam, and have Steam installed in C:\Program Files\Steam, then the path should be
 
So I've been tooling around with these to learn the goings-on of modeling. So I have the model finished and I'm doing LODs - I checked the OP and it says that you can have multiple layers with LODs on them (layer 1 has the custom LOD, layer 2 has view pilot, etc.) However, I went and put the model on different layers and then when I want to go and change the LOD for, layer 2 for example, it changes the LOD for all of the layers. So I want the custom LOD on layer 1 and the viewpilot on layer 2, when I change layer 2's LOD to viewpilot every layer changes to viewpilot. I'm very new to this and I don't know if the user guide has an answer (I checked and I don't see anything.)
 
I am not quite sure what you are doing. Note, however, that just switching the layer does not select an object. If you want to change the LOD of an object, you must select it, either by right-clicking on it in the 3D view, or in the outliner.
 
What do I need to be able to import rtm files in Blender? I use to be able to do it but after factory resetting my PC and adding Arma 3 tool again I no longer have the option to import rtm files. 

My import list
 
I am struggling to create a skinned vest from scratch. At the moment I am taking the .fbx character from the Arma 3 samples and skinning my mesh based on it's skeleton. When I get the mesh into game it loads up - but is locked to the player's root. Is there a guide which you could link to for exporting the mesh?
 
So far I'm able to successfully import the sample vest p3d file, export it and then load it up in game and it's working as expected. I feel like I'm missing an important step within Blender before exporting the mesh.
 
If your vest has weights assigned to it according to the OFP2 ManSkeleton, then you are probably missing a model.cfg entry for it.
Other than that, it's impossible to say what is going on without seeing the actual model.
 
You can also try to download the master branch by clicking on "Code" and selecting "Download ZIP", but you will have to install the stuff by hand since that ZIP archive does not work with the "Install Addon" in Blender.
 
Bezier curves don't seem to allow me to add arma3 properties or export, do I have to render to mesh first or is there a hidden option I am missing? I did tick "Apply Modifies" on export but I guess that's just the Modifiers? Other than that, this is the best plugin out there for blender for sure!
 
Ah no, you cannot export bezier curves. You can only export mesh objects (or Armatures as RTM). If you want to use a Bezier curve, you have to convert it to a mesh object before exporting.

Apply Modifiers does that, it applies the modifiers on the mesh object while exporting (on a copy of the object so the original is preserved).
 
Hi, i have a question about this addon, can this addon import some material or atleast make oxygen detect which material I use in a object? , because my object have some material, and when i'm export to p3d via arma toolbox, oxygen can't detect my material input in my object, this addon is work for object with 1 material, but doesn't work if I use for a object with 2 or more material.
 
The toolbox works with any number of materials. I think my record was something like 40 materials in one P3D. If it doesn't work for you you are doing something wrong, but in order to tell what I need more information.
 
Hi there, question about how the attributes work for the toolbox, I am unable to figure out how to by default have the attributes applied when starting a new project, is there an option somewhere to apply the attributes to a current model?

For instance, if I import a different P3D, and it exists next to the model I created, then the model that is a P3D with the toolbox setting will be exported, but not the regular one. How can I apply the toolbox settings to the non-imported model?
 
hello! So RTM can be imported into Blender. Is it possible for me to use a bone controller to adjust the actions? I've tried it before, it's really a mess, the controller on the hand is completely malfunctioning, and everything else is the same. Because you know the known Issues: "there are IK and other control bones won't work." I don't know if this plugin has been updated yet, as it would be more efficient for me to create character actions using Blender. So is there any solution? thanks.
 
I recently had a similar error and if I remember correctly I fixed it. I will have to make a new release ASAP, a lot has changed from the last.
If you are feeling adventurous, try the following: Open MDLexporter.py in a text editor and find the function convertWeight. The function starts like this

 
New Release 4.0.0
I just pushed a new release to the project homepage. This version is compatible with Blender 3.x as well as the new 4.0 release from yesterday. There is a metric excrement ton of new features that haven't been officially released yet, so make sure to read the release notes and feel free to ask questions.

Enjoy!
(first post updated as well)
 
I've designed and textured a house, and I now want to port it over to ArmA 3. I'm using blender to design it.When looking at tutorials, everyone seems to emphasize the LOD, which means Level of Detail. (Shown on the right) I have no clue what settings to use for a structure. The only tutorials i've seen are creating a weapon, which I'm assuming would need a low LOD since its in 1st person, but no one mentions the LOD settings of buildings, what value should I use?
