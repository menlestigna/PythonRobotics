Datacenters provide the physical infrastructure for the technology we depend on at work and in our personal lives. Whenever you open an app on your phone, join a virtual classroom or meeting, snap and save photos, or play a game with your friends online, you are using a datacenter. Local businesses, government, hospitals, and schools rely on datacenters every day to deliver goods and services to you.

Progress on constructing building two has notably progressed, with the majority of work on the structure, roofing, and faade nearing completion. Crews are now focused on installing key equipment and infrastructure as well as getting the surrounding areas ready for final paving operations.
 
The external construction of the first datacenter building, including the car park, walkways, and landscaping surrounding the area, is progressing to completion. The works are expected to be completed in the coming months.
 
An independent acoustic consultant has been engaged to conduct an assessment. It concluded that the vibrations are, and continue to be, well below acceptable levels indicated in the Noise and Vibration Management Plan approved by Blacktown Council.
 
The general contractor FDC Construction (NSW) Pty Ltd (FDC) is currently progressing the construction of the first of the two datacenter buildings on site, with the construction estimated to be completed by July 2023. Completion of construction does not indicate datacenter operation/availability.

With major structural works completed on the building, crews on site have been focusing on the internal buildout and the landscaping around the building. To ensure availability of parking by the construction site, contractors are not permitted to park along McCoy Street. A traffic controller is enforcing this daily.
 
The general contractor Taylor Construction Group Pty Ltd (Taylor) will start works on the second datacenter building in June 2023. Datacenter construction is expected to be completed by late 2024. Completion of construction does not indicate datacenter operation/availability.
 
Traffic control managers will be stationed daily at the entrance of the site on Station Road to help ensure that traffic flow is maintained and that public parking near the site remains accessible for local residents and businesses.

Our work on the Station B project has now been retired. We continue to actively explore the exciting intersection of computing and life sciences, with other projects located on www.microsoft.com/research. (opens in new tab)
 
These phases will be integrated with a biological knowledge base that stores computational models representing the current understanding of the biological systems under consideration. As new experiments are performed, the knowledge base will be updated via automated learning.
 
Technology partner Synthace (opens in new tab) provides a key abstraction layer for the digital encoding of biological experiments. Their Antha software allows the same digitally encoded experiment to be executed by a range of lab automation devices made by different manufacturers, much like printer drivers allow the same PDF to be printed by any make or model of printer. This ability to run experiments in the same way each time gives users higher confidence in their results. Antha aims to tackle the reproducibility crisis (opens in new tab) in biological experiments by digitally encoding all aspects of the experiment in a systematic fashion. It also allows substantial scaling up of experiments. This automated generation of reproducible experimental data at scale is a key requirement for machine learning, allowing users to pose and learn from much more sophisticated lines of inquiry.
 
A window station contains a clipboard, an atom table, and one or more desktop objects. Each window station object is a securable object. When a window station is created, it is associated with the calling process and assigned to the current session.
 
The interactive window station is the only window station that can display a user interface or receive user input. It is assigned to the logon session of the interactive user, and contains the keyboard, mouse, and display device. It is always named "WinSta0". All other window stations are noninteractive, which means they cannot display a user interface or receive user input.
 
When a user logs on to a computer using Remote Desktop Services, a session is started for the user. Each session is associated with its own interactive window station named "WinSta0". For more information, see Remote Desktop Sessions.
 
Located along SR 520 at the Overlake Transit Center site, this station provides increased parking for 300 cars and covered facilities for 100 bicycles. A bicycle/pedestrian bridge designed and funded by Microsoft spans SR 520, connecting the station to jobs and housing north of the freeway. This is the final station for the East Link Extension that opens in 2023. Extending the line to downtown Redmond, two additional stations open in 2024.
 
In August 2023, the Sound Transit Board voted for a phased approach to opening the East Link Extension, beginning with providing 2 Line service between South Bellevue and Redmond Technology stations in spring 2024. The 2 Line, which is not affected by quality issues related to construction, ahead of the I-90 segment.
 
**PROJECT:**Plaza 
**ARTIST:** Dan Webb (Seattle, WA)
**DESCRIPTION:** Webb is working on a monumental stone sculpture for the Redmond Technology Station's north entrance. An accomplished wood sculptor, Webb has taken the opportunity of this commission to explore a material better suited for an outdoor location: granite. Webb will cut his sculpture from a massive Cascade granite boulder, and will appear as if it is pushing itself apart with carved hands that emerge from within.
 
Affecting 72 acres of the sprawling 500-acre corporate campus, the Microsoft Campus Refresh will total 17 four- or five-story buildings. The modernization will have three million square feet of mostly office space, with retail making up the rest. The 17 buildings have been designated into four villages, which are at various stages of construction.
 
This campus will replace the original Microsoft buildings that totaled around 1.2 million square feet in office space. The new campus offers 2.5 miles of walking and bike trails, multi-purpose fields, and a cricket pitch. It will also be linked to the station with a bike and pedestrian bridge. Other green features that Microsoft is touting include 700 bike parking spaces, tree plantings/replanting, rainwater capture, and concrete reuse.
 
The 6,500-stall parking garage underneath the new campus in spite of the major transit investment on its doorstep and existing RapidRide service hardly speaks to world-class TOD. A 500-acre monoculture of office buildings does entail employees would have to commute in from afar. However, Microsoft is on par with its peers along the 2 Line; a parking ratio of 2.16 stalls per 1,000 square feet of office space is in line with current requirements throughout the corridor.
 
One new residential development in the station area prevents Microsoft from making the station a purely office and retail landscape. The Avalon Redmond Apartments at 15602 NE 40th St represents a sliver of multifamily residential zoning next to the Microsoft campus. It was completed in 2024 and contains 214 residential units and 215 parking stalls in a five-story building. Perhaps, more mixed-use development in future campus planning could help Microsoft wean itself off of its perceived car needs.
 
To be fair, the City of Redmond has been funneling much of its growth toward its downtown, which is tabbed to get light rail in 2025. That area has seen a transformation with a spate of mid-rise mixed-use development. Overlake has also been a focal point. However, certainly jurisdictions should be leaving housing capacity on the table when it comes to its zoning and land use regulations for areas near rapid transit.
 
In the 2023 election, the Seattle City Council saw a centrist shift. The biggest loss for centrists was erased as the newcomers, under pressure from major donors, appointed Tanya Woo to fill a temporary opening in Seat 8.
 
Your choices were to drive in stop-and-go traffic, trudge a narrow sidewalk past the 148th Avenue Northeast freeway ramps or catch a meandering bus. Bicyclists were better off detouring someplace else.
 
The Overlake bridge and station, along with neighboring****Redmond Technology Station, create new connections to roughly 50,000 jobs, along with thousands of apartments and open lots for redevelopment.
 
Altogether, the cities of Redmond, Bellevue and Seattle will have the best connections in the country between their high-tech districts, after light rail crosses Lake Washington in 2025, said Josh Brown, executive director of the Puget Sound Regional Council, which oversees metro-area planning and federal grants.
 
Neighbors have waited a couple of years since the main walkway spans were lifted over the highway, said Redmond City Councilmember Melissa Stuart, who lives at Overlake. Back in the 2010s, it seemed as if light rail were being plopped in an isolated area, she said.
 
Redmond spent $10.4 million for Sound Transit to build the Overlake bridge, about two-thirds federal grants and one-third from city business and real estate tax proceeds, said Carol Helland, city planning and community development director.
 
The two Redmond bridges are uniting a neighborhood, at the same time a national movement seeks to bridge, lid or even remove freew
