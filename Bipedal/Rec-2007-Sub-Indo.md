The name Indonesia was derived from "indos nesos", meaning islands near India, The country is in fact the largest archipelago in the world with thousands of islands, 17,508 to be precise, spread in an area between the Asian continent and Australia, and between the Pacific and the Indian oceans. The islands are inhabited by hundreds of tribes and thousands of sub-tribes with diverse cultures and languages. There is a national language spoken throughout the country, namely Bahasa Indonesia. It is thus appro - priate, that the country's motto is Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, which means: Unity in Diversity.
