Hi, I recently started getting into cyber security and thought of learning and getting credentials from Palo Alto would be a nice thing for my resume. But whenever I launch an e-learning course on Beacon, it just doesn't load. It just shows the buffering sign for an infinite amount of time. I tried creating a support ticket for this but the support section won't let me log in. Hence I am posting about this issue over here. I hope someone would be able to help me with this.
 
Are you experiencing similar problems ?
Could you add more info on what courses you're trying to access ? Also have you tested what @JayGolf mentioned earlier ? 

Worst case you can reach out to the learning platform beacon@paloaltonetworks.com

The national authority that accepts beacon registrations in the United States is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Here are three easy ways to register:
1.) The fastest and easiest way to register is online at www.beaconregistration.noaa.gov . Recommended method. **Verify and validate information before submitting**.
 
A beacon should be registered at the time of purchase or installation. The registration of a beacon is valid for 2 (two) years. The owner should re-register the beacon every two years. If a change of ownership occurs, the original owner must notify the authorities and de-register the beacon before the new owner can register.
 
Registering the EPIRB, ELT, or Personal Locator Beacon is required by law in the United States and in most countries. Registering is very important because should your beacon ever be activated, it is how Search and Rescue Teams will know who you are, and contacts provided may be able to supply information about your specific travel plans. In the absence of this information, it may take longer for a search-and-rescue operation to begin.
