Well, flashing stock firmware on Samsung Android devices is very easy but it might turn into a nightmarish experience if you are not careful enough with all prerequisites and installation steps. Suppose you are installing firmware and the battery juice drains away during the procedure, your phone or tablet might be hard-bricked. So make sure that your device is fully, or at least**60%** charged!
 
This is a very important thing to be done before you try flashing a firmware or recovery file. USB Debugging mode makes Android devices receptive to download and send data over a USB cable connection. If you do not know how to turn on USB debugging, do this:
 
Now download the recommended Odin tool for flashing the firmware on your Samsung device. As you know that there are several Odin versions available but considering the rate of success, you should use Odin3 v3.09 (for JellyBean and KitKat) or Odin3 v3.10.6 (for Lollipop).
 
After pressing the Volume Up key, your device will get into the Odin mode and it simply means that you can proceed with installing your firmware, CF-Auto-Root or CWM/TWRP recovery file. Here is how Download mode screen on Samsung devices looks like:

Hi rakesh thanks for your reply. The reason why I want to change the csc is to join the the Samsung s8& s8+ beta program,as this is not available in most countries. One more thing. Can I use the AP file only, instead of using all four files? Thanks

Hi. I want to upgrade my galaxy prime SM-G530H fortunave3g into lollipop and since my phone was bought second hand and i dont know if this is unlocked, how should i start? And is there a way to backup my kitkat firmware? I will download Panama lollipop firmware XCU asuming my phone is unlocked
 
Rakesh my friend! I did it! It actually failed and the worst part was, i forgot using kies or smart switch for backup! I was frustrated, and then i left it charging..and then i somehow thought about the usb driver, then i plugged the cord while the phone was off at the netbook, yes i was having a problem with odin3.9 because i cant press the start button, its beyond the screen so i used the odin3.10, then after i plugged the phone with usb while off, it charged, then it actually restarted the phone, till the updating phone appears, i was glad, i only wished it would succeed even just restoring my kitkat version custom device..but it didnt! It actually upgraded to lollipop and an official device at that! I dont know what happen but i am so happy right now, thanks a lot! ^^

I flashed the firmware trying to fix a problem that I have with my A5 2016, i used to show on the wipe data/factory reset screen that my phone had a problem with Ext4 and E:failed to find /misc partition.

Try keeping your device plugged to charger for a while. It might be case of deep discharge. If it begins to charge after some time, try turning it on and then perform a factory reset via recovery in case your device gets stuck at the Samsung logo.
 
hello sir i have got some problem with my samsung galaxy J700F device. The problem is that when i switch on my phone custom binary is blocked by FRP on. what does it mean and how this can be solved ? please help me
 
Help!!, i am installing the stock firmware to a galaxy s6, and its been 3 hours since i start, i dont know if thats normal, in the message section of odin just says NAND write start!! but nothing happens, i dont know if its normal that is taking so long, or should i unplugged the phone and start over, or wait more time, please if you could help me.

I have s4 sc04e from japan and it is very much differnt from original in firmware also and it contains alot of un usuful apps plz tell me how to flash internationl firmware or any other firmware which will work in sc04e plz its veri urgent
 
Thanks Rakesh, very helpful! Now all I have to do is find the Odin version that works. I tried flashing the four files using Odin v3.09, but I got a fail. Am I better to try later or earlier versions? My phone runs android 4.1.2.
 
New Zealand. Actually, it seems that some of the ROM has taken hold. I now have a SetUp Wizard and a lock screen. The notification panel also works. Apart from that, the screen is blank except for the very top panel, and the soft keys do not work. I have a sneaking suspicion that I disabled SystemUI from the app list, but I am not sure. I have since learned that this is the sytem user interface controller, so that could easily explain why I have no display or soft keys.
 
Like 1 2 3, the new files did the trick Thank you
I had no trouble at all I put the files on my sd card then loaded NC1 ran the new toolroot v3 and it just took a second. Rebooted put the NJ4 back on rebooted again checked 4.4.4 and still rooted Thank you
 
I have galaxy grand prime(sm-g530h). My device is rooted and have installed twrp. I have tried to flash the stock firmware. But every time it fails. Suggest me a way to do this successfully. I have tried to flash this using 2 or 3 odin versions.
 
Followed the instructions to the T and Odin came back with a Pass status and the phone rebooted and now it is stuck on the white AT&T logo on the screen and i cant seem to get past that. on a Note3 any ideas or suggestions?
