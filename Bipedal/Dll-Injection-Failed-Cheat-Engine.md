This is also a game on Steam, but this is freely distributed game on Steam.
Anyway, I followed the Nvidia guide, and then I could see the graphic analysis result, well.
I mean this game could be analyzed by using Nsight Graphics.

Sorry that you are running into these issues, but from looking at your description this is probably expected. Nsight Graphics uses dll injection to get profiling and rendering information from a process.
 
Cheats in games work exactly the same way, they inject into the process and then give the user information based on what they hook or even modify how the game works or what input is generated. To prevent this, developers block all process injection with anti-cheat engines. These anti-cheat engines block Nsight Graphics as well.

Use our SQL Injection Cheat Sheet to learn about the different variants of the SQL injection vulnerability. In this cheat sheet you can find detailed technical information about SQL injection attacks against MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and PostgreSQL SQL servers.
 
An SQL injection cheat sheet is a resource where you can find detailed technical information about the many different variants of the SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability. This SQL injection cheat sheet can be used as a reference for seasoned penetration testers but also as a general guide for those who are just getting started in web application security.
 
Currently, this SQL injection cheat sheet contains information for **MySQL**, **Microsoft SQL Server**, and some limited information for **ORACLE**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite**. As with any cheat sheet, some of the examples in this document might not work in every situation because real live environments will vary depending on the usage of parentheses, different code bases and unexpected, strange, and complex SQL sentences.
 
You can use inline comments to comment out the rest of a query as with line comments (by simply not closing the comment). They are also useful for manipulating characters to bypass filtering/blacklisting, remove spaces, and obfuscate queries. In MySQL, you can use its special comment syntax to detect the database and version.
 
This special comment syntax is perfect for detecting that MySQL is being used because any instructions you put in this comment will only execute in MySQL. You can even use this to detect the version. The following example will execute and generate an error only is the server uses MySQL in the specified version or later:
 
Note that results from the second query (and any additional queries) are not returned to the application. You need to use blind SQL injection methods to confirm that the second query is working, such as a delay, DNS query, etc.
 
Note that for MySQL, the above example will only work **if MySQL is running in ANSI mode**. Otherwise, MySQL will treat || as a logical operator and return 0. A better way it to use the CONCAT()function in MySQL:
 
Some applications store passwords not as plain text but as hashes, often MD5. The application may verify login credentials by first getting the user record based on the username and then checking if the hash of the input password value is correct.
 
If the application checks the hashed password, you will need an extra step to bypass authentication. You can UNION results with a known password and the MD5 hash of this password. The application will then compare your password and your supplied MD5 hash instead of the hash value from the database.
 
Using bcp, you can load files into a table or write table data to a file. Login credentials are required to use this utility. 
bcp "SELECT \* FROM test..foo" queryout c:\inetpub\wwwroot\runcommand.asp -c -Slocalhost -Usa -Pfoobar
 
In any decent production application, you generally cannot see any error responses on the page. This rules out extracting data directly through UNION attacks or error-based attacks. In these cases, you have to use blind SQL injections to extract the data. There are two basic kinds of blind SQL injections:
 
In normal blind injections, you can use IF statements or abuse WHERE clauses in queries, which is generally the easier route. For totally blind injections, you need to use some kind of wait function and then analyze the response times.
 
Since the last two queries both failed, we now know that 80 is the ASCII value of the first character of the table name, so the table name starts with the letter P. In this way, you can exploit blind SQL injections using a binary search algorithm. Another well-known way is to read data one bit at a time. Both methods can be effective in different conditions.
 
An out-of-band (OOB) SQL injection is done when you need to exfiltrate data through a different channel than you used for the injection. DNS is one of the most common out-of-band channels because DNS requests are rarely blocked.
 
This particular pump came from a 2015 Honda Fit that rolled into the shop with extended cranking and extremely low power. The check engine light was on and it had set a P0087 (Fuel rail pressure too low). The ECM monitors the fuel rail pressure using a pressure transducer. Fuel pressure in live data is 29 PSI. This is what the in-tank pump generates, so the high-pressure pump was doing nothing at all.
 
The ECM opens and closes the pressure regulator in time with the position of the 4 lobe cam on the cam shaft. During the piston down stroke the valve is open, allowing the cylinder to fill with fuel. When the piston starts to come up the the ECM closes the valve so the piston can develop pressure which is pushed past the check valve into the fuel rail. Pressure can be controlled changing the time when the valve closes. The closer to BDC the valve closes the higher the pressure. If the valve is closed later into the upstroke the pressure can be reduced.
 
Since this is a 4 cylinder engine, and direct injection pump cam is on the camshaft, the D.I. pump piston makes one stroke per firing event. I imagine peak pressure is developed about the time the of the injection event.
 
This page is for the UUU v3.0.x. This is the free version and won't be updated anymore. If you're looking for the UUU v4.x with camera paths and otheradditional features, please visit Otis\_Inf's Patreon page: the UUU v4.x is part of Tier 1.
 
For Unreal Engine 4 powered games, there's a universal way to add a free camera, add timestop, a hud toggle and re-create the in-game console (which is usually stripped out in released games): The Universal UE4 Unlocker, in short **UUU**. It comes with its own client exe, UuuClient.exe, and is ready to use. See below what you have to do to get started.
 
Now you first start the game and when the game has opened its main menu, you start the UuuClient.exe application to inject the UniversalUE4Unlocker.dll into the game's process and control its features. To do so, on the General tab you click the **Select...** button and select the game's process. You can leave the 'DLL to inject' as-is as it should already refer to the UniversalUE4Unlocker.dll.
 
After you've select the game's process, you click the **Inject DLL** button. The UUU dll is now injected and the General tab switches to the following screen: here, the UUU is injected into the Darksiders III game process.
 
If you click **Select** and the game process isn't shown, even though you know it's running, it's likely the game runs as administator and you therefore have to run the UuuClient.exe also as administrator: right-click the UuuClient.exe and select 'Run as Administrator' or create a shortcut to the exe on your desktop, right-click it, select Properties and on the Shortcut tab, select Advanced..., then check the 'Run as Administrator' checkbox and click OK.
 
After you've successfully injected the dll, you'll get a series of notification windows in the top left corner of your game window which some info regarding what the UUU is doing. You can now switch to the Available features tab to see which features of the UUU are available with the game you're using it with.
 
The **Game speed** can be used with the Slomo timestop when it's active. The **Dump object info** button can be used to dump all active object names and the addresses in memory to a text file on disk. This feature is helpful for people who want to use cheat engine with the game at hand. See for more info the object dumping section below.
 
It might be the UUU reports some elements aren't found while the game should be fully supported. This might be caused by assembly mismatches or the timing you injected the dll into the game process. If thishappens try to inject the DLL at moment after you've loaded the level or after the game's menu has fully loaded.
 
The UUU has various settings you can configure, which you'll do on the Configuration tab. Additionally you can define the key-shortcuts for various functionality on the Key bindings tab. These are discussed below
 
Most settings are for the built-in free camera and are self explanatory. The Game control device allows you to select which device to use for controlling the built-in free camera. By default it's both 'keyboard+mouse' and 'gamepad'. The device that's chosen is blocked by default to send its input to the game (as much as possible, sometimes this is unavoidable).
 
To change a key binding, click in the textbox and press the key combination you want to use, then click the **OK** button that appeared next to the textbox when you clicked it. If you changed your mind, just click **Cancel**. You can use the same key combination for multiple features. This allows you to e.g. use Insert for enabling the free camera, stopping time and hiding the HUD at the same time.
 
To do useful things like starting the debug camera, in a lot of games you first have to enable th
