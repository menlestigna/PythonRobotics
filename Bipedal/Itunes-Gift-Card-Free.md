I received an Apple Gift Card and according to what I read redeemed it into my iTunes Apple Id account so that I could use it to rent or purchase movies, music etc... When I go into my Apple TV and find a iTunes Movie that I wish to rent and select to rent it, I am prompted for the security code on the credit card I have setup for my iTunes Apple Payments.
 
Does anyone know whether my Gift Card balance will be charged or my credit card? I was expecting to see two payment options display like other companies do with their software when you have gift cards and I was expecting to simply select the Gift Card to use as payment.

I tried Apple Chat but that was not helpful. I am waiting for a phone call from tech support. Most things with Apple are very simple. Unfortunately, this is not. Does anyone out there in this community happen to know?
 
Technically, your answer is correct in that I could not redeem my gift card directly using Apple TV but I could redeem it to be used in iTunes or the App Store and so since my Apple TV allows me to rent iTunes Movies or TV programs, this transaction will be paid for by my gift card and the answer to my question is yes, I can use an Apple Gift Card to rent/buy movies or TV programming on my Apple TV. It is just not that obvious that I can do that or that the Apple TV transaction would work in the way I intended, namely being paid for using my gift card. There are easier more intuitive ways to program all of this that other companies use by displaying icons of gift cards and credit cards on file and allowing customers to select which they will use for payment. Apple uses Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) techniques in the design and development of their hardware and software with rigorous testing and so I suspect in the not too distant future they will improve all of this so that it is more intuitive and self evident to customers who use Apple TVs how they can make sure their gift card is being used for rentals and purchases until it is used up.
 
I should have thought to have included this information in my earlier reply, How App Store and iTunes Store purchases are billed - Apple Support which would have made it clear that store credit is used ahead of any credit or debit card. The CVV code may be requested the first time you make a transaction on a new device as an additional security measure to make sure that you approve of that device being used for purchases from your account.
 
See Redeem App Store & iTunes Gift Cards and content codes - Apple Support. As far as I am aware you cannot redeem the gift card to your Apple ID on the Apple TV, you will need to use iTunes or an iOS device.

I've been a Spotify Premium customer for a few months now, and I've always done my payments through a PayPal account. However, I have a few extra iTunes gift cards laying around that I can use as App store credit on my iPhone. Is there any way I could pay for 2 or 3 months of Premium ahead of time using up that App store credit? I'm also aware paying through the app store is 13$ or so because of Apple's fees, but I still have nearly 50$ of iTunes gift cards that would otherwise be going to waste. Thanks ahead of time for any replies!

Right now subscriptions can not be purchased through the iOS app (via iTunes). In the past during Spotify's introduction offer, users would accidentally subscribe through the app instead of the website causing a lot of confusion. This decision was made to make the offer go more smoothly. Sorry for the inconvenience.
 
If this is the case and you are still unable to purchase a premium subscription through the in-app subscription, you need to contact apple as they deal with all payments that go through the App Store.
 
I have been asked by paypal to buy a $100 iTunes gift card before I can receive my payment that has been sent to me. They said they will accredit my account the $100 buy why would I need to buy a ITunes card?
 

Its a SCAM.
It would not be paypal customer services that you called it would be a FAKE number pretending to be paypal customer services.
The number shows up when you use 'google' to find paypals number OR a scammer has posted a thread in this forum.
Most times these threads get reported and removed but some slip through.
The scammers post genuine advice but the phone number is in the title or post often in a strange format to get around paypals security.
That is why paypal NEVER post their phone number on this forum.
The only way to get the REAL paypal customer services number is via help / contact bottom left of paypal pages and scrolling down past the FAQ to the 'call us' option to phone them.
If you think about it why would paypal ask you to buy google vouchers or itunes cards to answer your question or issue you a refund etc?
 
I just got a $15 iTunes gift card and I want to spend it (duh!). My question is this : can I use it to buy a premium membership here at chess.com? Like if I wanted to buy a one month gold membership, can I use my iTunes gift card, or does it get charged to the credit card I used to set up my apple account? When I try to buy a premium account in the iOS app, it asks me if I want to confirm the purchase, just like it does when I buy something else in-app. I know that it just comes out of my giftcard on others in-app purchases, but I didn't want to buy it before I knew the answer.
 
Also, will this work for google play as well? I couldn't find an answer to this in any other forum, so if it has been answered already, my apologies! I would like a premium membership, but don't want to use my credit if I can just use the iTunes gift card. Thanks for your time!
 
Hi, I got 2 15$ iTunes cards for Christmas. I put them on my iPod thinking I could purchase a membership with them and it won't let me enforcing me to use a credit card. Is there any way around this? Thank you.
