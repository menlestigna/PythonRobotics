**Squares 1 to 30** is the list of squares of all the numbers from 1 to 30. The value of squares from 1 to 30 ranges from 1 to 900. Memorizing these values will help students to simplify the time-consuming equations quickly. The **squares from 1 to 30** in the exponential form are expressed as (x)2.
 
Learning squares 1 to 30 can help students to recognize all perfect squares from 1 to 900 and approximate a square root by interpolating between known squares. **The values of squares 1 to 30 are listed in the table below.**

The students are advised to memorize these squares 1 to 30 values thoroughly for faster math calculations. The link given above shows **square 1 to 30 pdf** which can be easily downloaded for reference.
 
In this method, the number is multiplied by itself and the resultant product gives us the square of that number. For example, the square of 4 = 4 4 = 16. Here, the resultant product '16' gives us the square of the number '4'. This method works well for smaller numbers.

The value of **squares upto 30** is the list of numbers obtained by multiplying an integer by itself. When we multiply a number by itself we will always get a positive number. For example, the square of 12 is 122 = 144.
 
We can calculate the square of a number by using the a + b + 2ab formula. For example (19) can be calculated by splitting 19 into 10 and 9. Other methods that can be used to calculate squares from 1 to 30 are as follows:
 
I have assembled the transimpedance amplifier with OPA847 for balanced homodyne detection. Feedback resistance 4.3 kOm, feedback capacitance(with parasitic capacitance of feedback resistor) 0.4 pF. The scheme is:
 
"After having built the HD we proceed to test its performance. To that end, we place it in the experimental set-up shown in Fig. 5. Our LO is obtained from a modelocked Coherent MIRA 900 Ti:Sapphire laser producing 1.8 ps pulses with a repetition rate of 76 MHz, central wavelength of 791 nm. The HD beam splitter configuration is implemented by using a half wave plate and a polarizing beam splitter. The two beams coming out of the beam splitter are focused into the photodiodes. The HD is balanced by first adjusting the waveplate in order to equalize the responses of the photodiodes, compensating for a possible difference in their quantum efficiencies, thereby minimizing the spurious signal at the local oscillator repetition rate. A further crucial step in balancing the HD is to equalize the path lengths of the two beams entering the photodiodes by using a XY translation stage on which the HD is mounted. This is necessary because the pulses, if arriving at the photodiodes at different times, can lead to subtraction pulse having a bipolar shape. Even after these alignment steps, the subtraction may not be perfect due to different capacitances of the two photodiodes."

I suggest high gain in 0-30 MHz doesn't result from parasitic cap/inducance . The 13V voltage was applied for each photodiodes. Hamamatsu S5972 bandwidth is 500 MHz at 10 V, so it didn't limit frequency response. I put 50 Om resistor on the ground before output BNC to exclude cable influence on frequency response.
 
When looking at the frequency response of the TIA, I think the normalization needs to happen with respect to the gain at the low frequency end. This is because the chances of matching the trans-impedance (Tz) gain at lower frequencies is higher between simulation and measurement. If I then look at the frequency response, you seem to have a gain droop between 10 MHz to 40 MHz.
 
Looking at your setup, you seem to put a 50-ohm resistor to ground before the output BNC on your board. We do not normally recommend to put a 50-ohm resistor from the output to ground because it loads the op-amp directly when you connect the output BNC to any electrical equipment. You seem to have connected the output BNC to the digital oscilloscope as well as the spectrum analyzer which presents a combined load of 16.67 ohms at the OPA847 output (if I assume 50-ohms input for both the oscilloscope and the analyzer). The 16.67 ohms load at the output is a pretty heavy load and might be responsible for causing the gain droop between 10 MHz to 40 MHz. In reality, you need a series 50-ohms from OPA847 output to the BNC such that the output is isolated from the test equipment.
 
I also tried replicating your setup in my bench here for an Rf = 4.3k and assumed PD cap of 6.8pF. Attached is the measurement result that matches somewhat with the simulation and shows no gain droop in the frequency response between 10-40 MHz.
 
Rohit, sorry for my late reply. Thank you. I have to think more about the output circuit. It might be one of the reasons. At least I should understand how output circuit after OPA847 influence input signal.
 
Radial distortion causes straight lines to appear curved. Radial distortion becomes larger the farther points are from the center of the image. For example, one image is shown below in which two edges of a chess board are marked with red lines. But, you can see that the border of the chess board is not a straight line and doesn't match with the red line. All the expected straight lines are bulged out. Visit Distortion (optics) for more details.
 
Similarly, tangential distortion occurs because the image-taking lense is not aligned perfectly parallel to the imaging plane. So, some areas in the image may look nearer than expected. The amount of tangential distortion can be represented as below:
 
In addition to this, we need to some other information, like the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera. Intrinsic parameters are specific to a camera. They include information like focal length ( \(f\_x,f\_y\)) and optical centers ( \(c\_x, c\_y\)). The focal length and optical centers can be used to create a camera matrix, which can be used to remove distortion due to the lenses of a specific camera. The camera matrix is unique to a specific camera, so once calculated, it can be reused on other images taken by the same camera. It is expressed as a 3x3 matrix:
 
For stereo applications, these distortions need to be corrected first. To find these parameters, we must provide some sample images of a well defined pattern (e.g. a chess board). We find some specific points of which we already know the relative positions (e.g. square corners in the chess board). We know the coordinates of these points in real world space and we know the coordinates in the image, so we can solve for the distortion coefficients. For better results, we need at least 10 test patterns.
 
So to find pattern in chess board, we can use the function, **cv.findChessboardCorners()**. We also need to pass what kind of pattern we are looking for, like 8x8 grid, 5x5 grid etc. In this example, we use 7x6 grid. (Normally a chess board has 8x8 squares and 7x7 internal corners). It returns the corner points and retval which will be True if pattern is obtained. These corners will be placed in an order (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
 
Now that we have our object points and image points, we are ready to go for calibration. We can use the function, **cv.calibrateCamera()** which returns the camera matrix, distortion coefficients, rotation and translation vectors etc.
 
Now, we can take an image and undistort it. OpenCV comes with two methods for doing this. However first, we can refine the camera matrix based on a free scaling parameter using **cv.getOptimalNewCameraMatrix()**. If the scaling parameter alpha=0, it returns undistorted image with minimum unwanted pixels. So it may even remove some pixels at image corners. If alpha=1, all pixels are retained with some extra black images. This function also returns an image ROI which can be used to crop the result.
 
Re-projection error gives a good estimation of just how exact the found parameters are. The closer the re-projection error is to zero, the more accurate the parameters we found are. Given the intrinsic, distortion, rotation and translation matrices, we must first transform the object point to image point using **cv.projectPoints()**. Then, we can calculate the absolute norm between what we got with our transformation and the corner finding algorithm. To find the average error, we calculate the arithmetical mean of the errors calculated for all the calibration images.
 
Solving equations is the central theme of algebra. All skills learned lead eventually to the ability to solve equations and simplify the solutions. In previous chapters we have solved equations of the first degree. You now have the necessary skills to solve equations of the second degree, which are known as *quadratic equations*.
 
An important theorem, which cannot be proved at the level of this text, states "Every polynomial equation of degree n has exactly n roots." Using this fact tells us that quadratic equations will always have two solutions. It is possible that the two solutions are equal.
 
We will not attempt to prove this theorem but note carefully what it states. We can never multiply two numbers and obtain an answer of zero unless at least one of the numbers is zero. Of course, both of the numbers can be zero since (0)(0) = 0.
 
The solutions can be indicated either by writing x = 6 and x = - 1 or by using set notation and writing 6, - 1, which we read "the solution set for x is 6 and - 1." In this text we will use set notation.
 
Notice that if the c term is missing, you can always factor x from the other terms. T
