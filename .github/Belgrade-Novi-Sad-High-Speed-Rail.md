On March 19, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Belgrade-Budapest high-speed railway, connecting Serbia and Hungary, marked its two years' anniversary. Since the 75-kilometer section began operations in 2022, it has carried 6.83 million passenger trips.
 
The Belgrade-Budapest high-speed railway is undertaken by China Railway International Co Ltd and a Chinese consortium. It is a key project in the collaboration between China and Central and Eastern European countries under the Belt and Road Initiative.
 
Hungary is the first European country and Serbia was among the first countries to sign a cooperation document with China on joint promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Since then, their relations have become increasingly close. The fruitful Belt and Road cooperation among these countries is a testament to the mutually beneficial cooperation. For example, the Belgrade-Budapest railway is a flagship project under the BRI.
 
Connecting the capital cities of Hungary and Serbia, the Budapest-Belgrade railway is a 350-kilometer-long double-track electrified high-speed rail line project. The outdated Budapest-Belgrade railway is being modernized to improve the connectivity between Hungary and Serbia.
 
The project involves the construction of new second tracks to deliver a new double-track line and the reconstruction of existing single-track along the route. The 341.7 km Belgrade-Budapest rail line project covers the construction of 183.1 km tracks in Serbia and 158.6 km in Hungary. The dual-purpose railway will transport passengers and freight between the capitals of Serbia and Hungary.
 
This railway line was designed to accommodate passenger trains with speeds of up to 200 km/h from the current 80 km/h, while the trains on the route will be able to operate at a speed of 160km/h. This new high-speed rail will provide a transport connection in just two hours and 40 minutes between Belgrade and Budapest from the current eight hours. The rail line will comply with European Train Control System (ETCS) standards as per EU requirements.
 
In Hungary, the rail project involves the modernization of a 152 km single-track line, the building of its double track covering a total track restoration of 339 km and the deployment of the ETCS Level 2. The project also includes the upgrade and modernization of eight stations and the reconstruction of five stations. Work on the Hungarian section commenced in July 2020 and entered the civil engineering construction phase in February 2022.
 
In Serbia, the project includes three primary sections: the 34.5 km Belgrade-Stara Pazova section, the 40.4 km Stara Pazova-Novi Sad and Novi Sad-Subotica (towards the border) with a length of 108.1 km.
 
The 80-kilometer section, which links Belgrade and Novi Sad, the capital and second-largest city of Serbia, began operations in March 2022. On average, more than 50 train services on the route have been operated daily from 5:30 am to 10:30 pm since the railway opened.
 
The Belgrade-Budapest railway project achieved a significant milestone as the tracks on the Novi Sad-Subotica section were successfully connected on April 25, 2024, in the Serbian city of Backa Topola.
 
The Serbian section of the Belgrade-Budapest railway line will be completed by the end of 2024. The Hungary section is currently under construction. Initially projected completion of the entire project is by summer 2026, however the recent progress suggests an earlier completion by the end of 2025 if all goes according to plan.
 
The Belgrade-Budapest high-speed railway, once completed and connected with railways in Greece, will be a land-to-sea passage in Central Europe via Greek ports, offering unprecedented access to the sea for both Serbia and Hungary. Also, this railway line forms a crucial part of ongoing rail infrastructure development in the Western Balkans, offering a shorter transport corridor than the currently existing alternatives.
 
This rail line is also expected to significantly improve the local transportation, which will contribute to the formation of the China-Europe international trade corridor, and promote the development of the local economy. The project is expected to bring remarkable economic benefits to both countries and transform Hungary into a regional logistics hub.
 
As a flagship project of cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries, the Hungary-Serbia Railway is an important part of the European transport corridor and the China-Europe Land and Sea Express Line. It is of great significance to the synergetic development between the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and European development strategies. Since its commencement, the project has garnered widespread attention.
 
On March 19, 2022, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway in Serbia went into operation. This new route has not only facilitated local passengers, but also placed Serbia among the nations with high-speed rail. According to statistics, the Belgrade-Novi Sad section has carried 6.83 million passengers during its two years of operation.
 
Passenger Milika often travels between the two cities. She said that a one-way high-speed rail ticket from Belgrade to Novi Sad costs less than 5 euros ($5.33), and a monthly pass provides even greater affordability. Driving between the two cities would cost over 10 euros in tolls, fuel, and parking fees, with a travel time of over an hour, Milika added.
 
Nenad Stanisavljević, head of public relations department of Serbian Railways, noted that an increasing number of Serbians are now accustomed to taking the high-speed rail, as it is comfortable and provides a safer and more convenient travel experience.
 
Veselin Simović, a person in charge of railway infrastructure in the Novi Sad region, said that the original Hungary-Serbia railway line was constructed in 1883 and had severely aged. Some sections were no longer operational, while the maximum speed on the operational sections was less than 40 kilometers per hour. Delays of trains often happened, Simović added.
 
"Now we have a stable daily ridership of 8,000 to 10,000 passengers, with even more on weekends. Taking a high-speed rail to Belgrade for work in the morning and returning to Novi Sad in the evening has become a choice for many people," said Simović.
 
Milan Banović, chief engineer of the Hungary-Serbia Railway, has joined the project since its inception. Speaking of his experience working with Chinese colleagues, he said, "I learned a lot from them, and together with my Serbian engineer colleagues, we helped our Chinese counterparts resolve many localization issues. Our cooperation was very pleasant. Last year, I visited China twice and even rode on Chinese high-speed trains, which left a profound impression on me."
 
Near the Novi Sad station, track-laying work has commenced for the Novi Sad-Subotica section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway. The section is expected be completed by the end of 2024, which will mark the completion of the Serbian section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway.
 
During his visit to the construction site, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he was satisfied with the progress of the construction of the Novi Sad-Subotica railway section. He thanked the Chinese companies for their efforts to complete the project ahead of schedule.
 
"This is a significant change for the Serbian people and the entire country, as travel time between Belgrade and Subotica will be reduced to just 75 minutes," Vucic said, expecting the enhancement to attract more tourists.
 
In her view, Serbia needs a modernized railway to support the country's overall development. The Hungary-Serbia Railway not only facilitates transportation within Serbia but also connects the European continent, increasing freight capacity and transit capability.
