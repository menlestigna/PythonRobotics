The Granny Patch quilt pattern is finally in the shop and I'm back to share about another sample! And it's such a good one, my friends! By now, you've seen the Cover Granny Patch quilt, the 70s Velvet inspired Granny patch quilt and I'm calling this one 80s Party. :)
 
I'm no stranger to a quilt with a dark charcoal background. In fact, I would argue that it's my preferred background color, A- because it's practical, as far as keeping it clean and such; and B- because I think it makes the other fabrics look better. It's practically a science...tones are richer, color are more distinct. If you're curious for examples, here's a list of quilts that I've made in the past with darker backgrounds. Click through to see what I mean!

It's pretty eye-opening to list out these quilts! I knew I liked charcoal, but maybe didn't realize just how much, haha. But needless to say, Granny Patch is another one of those quilts that just looks SO good with a darker background. I think it's something about having background space around each individual piece of Foreground fabric...means that the Background plays SUCH an important role in the over all look of your quilt.
 
If you missed our announcement on Wednesday, we are so excited to offer digital coloring pages for the VERY first time. We've partnered with PreQuilt to bring you a FREE digital coloring page experience so that you can plan your quilt with confidence and bring your fabric ideas to life. Through PreQuilt, you can use their pre-loaded solid fabric swatches (hello Kona & AGF), randomize colors, and try new ideas so that you have a quilt plan before you get started. *(There's also a paid version if you'd like to save your ideas, upload prints and more!)*? We are so excited to offer this for Granny Patch! Let us know what you think and if you'd like to see it for other patterns as well!
 
We welcomed Elizabeth (@elizabethboltenstudio) to the Lo & Behold team last month as our Creative Project Manager and she specifically wanted to make this sample because it reminded her of a crocheted afghan that her grandmother made. I love that quilting can hold such a special meaning beyond creating the physical quilt. The connection to the past and special memories that it evokes is hands down my favorite part of this craft.
 
Elizabeth also free-motion quilted this quilt! If you look at the last page of the pattern, there's a "Bonus: Quilting Ideas" section and she quilted the Orange Peel idea. Impressive, right?? She used a darker thread in the background, so that part really blends in. Then she used a lighter thread in the foreground to outline each foreground square within the block. Free-motion quilting isn't something that I've ventured into quite yet, but I'm always so impressed by folks who free-motion quilt their quilts!
 
I am using Bernat Super Value Yarn which has the perfect red and green Christmas shades (Berry and Lush) and I added in a turquoise that coordinates so nicely! You can purchase this worsted weight yarn directly at Yarnspirations.com!

In this post I will give you the pattern for version #2 of the Gift Box Granny Square (version #1 can be found HERE) and then in a follow up post I will show you how to join the squares and add a border.
 
**Border Round 1:** Still with green attached, begin to SC around the edges (making a SC + chain 2 + SC in each corner). When you get to the red parts on your edge, you will switch to red yarn so the colors match up. See video tutorial above for help changing colors and tips and tricks. Join to the beginning green stitch and add in white.
 **Border Round 2:** With white yarn SC in each stitch around (on first 3 edges) making a SC + chain 2 + SC in the corners. When you get to the last edge (where the top of your ribbon bow will be) you will stop 5 stitches before the ribbon stripe and change to red. SC 13 stitches in red, switch back to white and SC in the remaining stitches until you get back to your first SC and join, chain 1. See picture below or video tutorial for help.
 
With three granddaughters and two grandsons, I would have a lot of crocheting to do, but I honestly think I can make these. Your photos are amazing and really show how to do the work so clearly that I can follow them even if the instructions swim in my head. ? Thank you! Thank you!
 
Hello! The first time I saw this pattern I thought of the project at our church for Operation Christmas Child. Their shoeboxes are the red and green theme, so I am going to make one out of 100% cotton for a washcloth to see if I need to change the size of the block.
 
This page contains a detailed **version history** for *Granny* in chronological order. The original mobile changelogs can be viewed on the Google Play Store and App Store. PC changelogs can be viewed on the Granny Steam announcements page.
 
Headings will use the version number of the Android updates, as it has the longest history and number of updates. Information about their equivalent version numbers on other platforms will be provided before listing update information.
 
The Granny Stripe is a crochet pattern that is made just like the iconic Granny Square, but instead of stitching around and around a center square, it is made by stitching back and forth in rows. The beauty of the Granny Stripe pattern is how effortlessly it lends itself to graphic elements, like bright stripes or big blocks of color.
 
For my Granny Stripe blanket I used the incomparable Madeline Tosh, Tosh Merino Light. As I worked on the blanket I fell madly in love with this yarn, it is an amazingly strong but delicate single ply beauty. Tosh Merino Light comes in an astonishing range of gorgeous hand dyed color, and truly any one of them (or any dozen!) would make an incredible Granny Stripe blanket. Above are a handful of colors I really love and considered for the blanket, the off white is Antler, the top stripe is Edison Bulb (both used in my blanket), then Citrus, Napoli, Oceana and Denim. -Joelle
 
Main Color Granny Row: Ch 3 (counts as 1 dc), 1 dc into very first stitch, [3 dc into next space between dc groups] repeat to last space, 2 dc into last space and then 1 dc into 3rd stitch of ch 3 from previous row.
 
Hello, I'm planning a little blog post on inspiring crochet blankets, and I love this modern take on the crochet blanket you've created, so I wanted to put a link to your pattern on my blog.   
I would also like to ask for permission to use one of your photos above in my blog post, with the link, I find that people are so much more likely yo follow a link if they have a visual indication to inspire them.  
Many thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you.  
Best wishes, Vanessa x
 
I have used the same technique for a single crochet foundation row. Just eliminate the very first yarn over, and off you go. It is so much easier than counting, and then working into, a really long flimsy chain.
 
Awesome! This blanket makes me want to learn crochet. I think I will give it a go:) BTW, I just visited your new shop location a few days ago as I was on a mini vacation to NY. It is delightful for sure. I so wish I lived closer-CA is much too far away from Purl ?
 
Hi there! So I am brand spankin new to crochet and decided to tackle this project because I adore it (thank you for posting it!). Everything is going swimmingly, BUT my foundation row is much much tighter than the main color section. Is there a way to re-do the foundation row without having to undo the entire thing and fix the tension issue? Or some version of the foundation row in the contrast color that I may be able to replace the original foundation row with?
 
You could certainly crochet the larger gray rectangles separately and then crochet them all together with the yellow later. Joelle recommends that you do a row of single crochet at the beginning and end of each rectangle using the yellow so it will be easier to piece together later.
 
Unfortunately we are no longer carrying the Cascade Heritage. Right now the original yarn that this is made with (Madeline Tosh Merino Light) is actually the best value for its weight since you get a whopping 420 yards for less than $20 and it comes in such great colors.
 
Unfortunately there really isn't another yarn in that gague and color I can think of. We are currently sold out of it but we do ship to the UK so please drop us a line at customerservice AT purlsoho DOT com if you'd like to get an email when it comes back in.
 
Hi Molly! I love this pattern, but was thinking of doing it in a larger gauge yarn to achieve a larger blanket without chaining 600+ stitches! Do you think this is a feasible pattern with a worsted weight yarn, or will one sacrifice aesthetics?
 
Thank you for the wonderful pattern! I am hoping to make this as a wedding gift. I would like to use the Tosh Merino Light in some of its new colors, maybe Calligraphy and Scarlett. However it seems I cannot purchase 10 skeins of one color, which is what you have specified in your pattern. Any suggestions for how to get that much of this lovely yarn? Thank you!
 
We are currently waiting on 6 skeins of Calligraphy but we do have 12 of the Scarlett available now. The best thing to do would be to drop our webstore a line at customerservice AT purlsoho DOT com and let them know the quantities and colors you'd like. They'd be happy to place a special order for you.
 
Hi I am looking to make this as a baby blanket, how many skeins of the main color and border color would you recommend I purchase? I also noticed that the colors antler and edison bulb is out of stock in your online store, what other colors would you recommend instead?  
Thanks!
 
To make it 30-inches wide, we would suggest 1 of the contrasting color, and 6 of the main color. Currently we are very low on this yarn and
