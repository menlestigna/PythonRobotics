Finally, an answer confirming they atleast know about the issue, thank you. Someone deleted my thread detailing a question about whats going on without bothering to answer and I still dont have a reply from support. Extremely frustrating.
 
I recently have bought Plants vs zombies 1 Game Of The Year Edition (Not GW) And when I try to open it I get a message box saying "We could not activate plants vs zombies on this computer using the origin account you provided please locate your product key to activate the game using your Origin account, It never gave me a product key and when I click Enter Product Key it opens up another message box that wants me to register a new account.
 
putting a solution something so random such as "keep trying to access" is so bad.
you are putting this problem under your shoes, saying other people are just bad and didn't try it.
very bad from you and EA assistance,
already having to switch language for a 2017 games is a joke otherwise you can't play it,
assistance was a joke asking me more than 10 times to show them a prove i owned the game.
at least put as solution something valid not a random thing like that.
that worked only for you in your specific case.
the switching language thing helped more people than this, and i'm sure it will help more
 
A lot of zombies are invading your home, forget weapons because your only defense is an arsenal of 49 zombie-zapping plants. Use peashooters, wall-nuts, cherry bombs and many more plants to annihilate hordes of 26 types of zombies before they reach your house.

Use your garden to plant all kind of plants, each one of them with different features, they explode, fire, double fire, freeze and more. Choose the ones you need, grow sunflowers and use the sun to earn points to grow more plants. Be careful, each zombie has its own special skills, so you have to think the plant that will kill them faster.
 
From time to time, your crazy neighbor will help you and will tell you some tricks. Each time you pass a level, you'll gain a new kind of plant, and the further you go, the more zombies will attack you.

***Plants vs. Zombies*** is a video game franchise developed by PopCap Games, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts (EA). The series follows the affiliates of David "Crazy Dave" Blazing as they use his plants to defend against a zombie invasion, led by Dr. Edgar George Zomboss. The first game, *Plants vs. Zombies* (2009), was developed and released by PopCap before its acquisition by EA. After PopCap Games's acquisition, EA expanded the game into a franchise with games on many different platforms.
 
On April 1, 2009, PopCap released a music video for the song "Zombies on Your Lawn" by Laura Shigihara to promote *Plants vs. Zombies*.[2] A PopCap spokesperson, Garth Chouteau, revealed in an *IGN* interview that *Plants vs. Zombies* would be released soon on PC and Mac.[3] On April 22, 2009, PopCap released an official game trailer of *Plants vs. Zombies* on YouTube.[4][5] During the promotion of *Plants vs. Zombies*, PopCap released a demo version of the game that could be played for thirty minutes.[6] *Plants vs. Zombies* was officially released on May 5, 2009, for PC and Mac,[7] by 2013 switching from a $2.99 gameplay cost to free-to-play on iOS and Android devices. Critics on mobile devices give the game an average of 4.3-4.8 star ratings.[8]
 
PopCap Games and its assets were bought by EA on July 12, 2011, for 750 million US dollars.[9] Fifty employees were laid off in the Seattle studio of PopCap Games on August 21, 2012, to mark a switch of focus to mobile and social gaming.[10]
 
On August 20, 2012, PopCap announced that they were working on a sequel to *Plants vs. Zombies*.[11] Its release date would be set at late spring of 2013.[12] However, the game's status was in doubt shortly after the announcement when the company went through a period of layoffs.[10]

Along with these new add ons, the game continues to make updates from time to time. According to EA News, the Arena and Penny's Pursuit updates, which are different game modes within the game, have been some of their latest major updates, aside from all the mini add ons.[18]
 
In July 2019, EA announced *Plants vs. Zombies 3*, another free-to-play mobile title in the series. It was launched in a pre-alpha state for Android in July 2019.[19][20] The game soft-launched in February 2020 in the Philippines, Romania, and Ireland.[21] It was then made unavailable in October 2020, becoming unplayable in November 2020. EA has plans to release an improved version of the game in the future.[22] On September 7, 2021, *Plants vs. Zombies 3* was soft-launched again with substantial changes, such as two-dimensional graphics and the return of the Sunflower as a plantable plant, having the same purpose in the previous iterations.[23] On January 17, 2024, *Plants vs. Zombies 3* was soft launched again, this time as *Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia* in select regions,[1] adapting storylines and characters from the *Plants vs. Zombies* comic book series (written by Paul Tobin, illustrated by Ron Chan, and published by Dark Horse Comics), including Tugboat the Zombie and Patrice Blazing.[24]
 
A spin-off called *Plants vs. Zombies Adventures* was announced in March 2013[25] and was released on May 20, 2013 on Facebook. The game added new locations and new plants. It also had a gameplay feature in which the player had a limited amount of plants and had to grow more plants at an in-game farm.[26] In July 2014, it was announced that *Plants vs. Zombies Adventures* would close on October 12, 2014.[27]
 
*Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare* was announced at E3 2013 as a multiplayer third-person shooter game made for PC and consoles.[28][29] *Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare* was released on February 25, 2014, in North America and on February 27, 2014, in Europe.[30] A sequel, *Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2*, was teased in June 2015 and was officially announced at E3 2015.[31][32] The game was released on February 23, 2016.[33] On March 10, 2016, PopCap announced *Plants vs. Zombies Heroes*, a digital collectible card game in the style of tower defense.

It was released in an early access state that same date. The game was fully released on October 18, 2019.[37][38]
 
A cancelled single player *Plants vs. Zombies* game had been in the works within EA from about 2015 to 2017. Known as "Project Hot Tub" in reference to *Hot Tub Time Machine*, the game was to have been an action game along the lines of the *Uncharted* series but maintaining its family-friendly nature, featuring two teenage siblings that travelled through time to fight zombies. The game was being developed by PopCap Vancouver. While a vertical slice of the game had been shown off to EA executives in 2017, EA opted to cancel the project to pull in more resources to Visceral Games to support their work on the *Star Wars* game under the name *Project Ragtag*, which had been languishing for several years. Despite this, EA cancelled *Project Ragtag* in October 2017, shutting down Visceral Games, and the former PopCap Vancouver team was relocated across other EA studios.[39]
 
Since July 2013, Dark Horse Comics has published a *Plants vs. Zombies* ongoing comic book series, following teenagers Nate Timely and Patrice Blazing as they protect Neighborville from the zombie armies of Dr. Edgar Zomboss, with the help of Patrice's uncle, David "Crazy Dave" Blazing, and his own legion of genetically-modified sentient plants, accessible via the *Plants vs. Zombies* Comics app.[40] Elements and characters from the comic book series were later adapted to the franchise's video game instalments, and vice-versa.[41]
