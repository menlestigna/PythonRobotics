Ki Pro Ultra 12G is a multi-channel Apple ProRes recorder offering up to 4-Channels of simultaneous HD recording, or in Single-Channel mode, a 4K/UltraHD/2K/HD Apple ProRes or Avid DNxHR recorder and player. Avid DNxHD MXF is also supported up to HD formats in Single-Channel mode.
 
Ki Pro Ultra 12G offers 12G-SDI single cable simplicity for large rasters up to full 4K, (the 4x 3G-SDI inputs/outputs can be used for Quad Link operations as required) and HDMI 2.0 digital video connectivity with HDR support for both recording and playback.
 
The video and audio connections on the rear panel of the Ki Pro Ultra 12G offer next generation connectivity with single channel 12G-SDI I/O over either BNC or optional FIber and three additional 3G-SDI ports for multi-channel HD or quad-link capture needs. HDMI 2.0 I/O offers single cable simplicity all the way up to 4K. AES and analog XLR balanced audio, LTC, RS-422 and LAN round out the package.

Simplify your multi-camera productions by running up to four cameras per Ki Pro Ultra 12G and save power, space, time and effort on set, in the studio and when setting up OB trucks. Ki Pro Ultra 12G even allows independent profile support per channel in Multi-Channel mode; for example, select high resolution Apple ProRes HQ for high quality finishing and use a second input to record Apple ProRes (Proxy) for an efficient editing pipeline.
 
Starting with input 1, add channels as needed in order when utilizing like raster size and frame rate, and record your HD Apple ProRes files on the same AJA PAK media\*. Ki Pro Ultra 12G even allows rollover to a second PAK for hours of uninterrupted multi-channel recording. Internal frame synchronizers eliminate the need for sources to be genlocked, which can be especially useful when setting up live events.
 
Ki Pro Ultra 12G also allows users to record 4K and UltraHD rasters with Avid codecs within an MXF wrapper, supporting Avid editors and native MXF workflows with more flexible options.
Ki Pro Ultra 12GSD offers Avid DNxHR codecs in an MXF wrapper for the following formats:
 
Multi-Channel recording with Ki Pro Ultra 12G provides individual, discrete recordings for each input that are timecode accurate and ready to be imported directly into a multi-channel editing sequence. No additional conversion or software is required, just drag and drop the files directly from the PAK Media into your edit. The clip naming convention is yours to customize to suit your needs, but each multi-channel file is always appended with \_1, \_2, \_3 or \_4 matching the input, making it very easy to track assets in post.
 
Combine Ki Pro Ultra 12G with Ki Pro GO for simultaneous high quality capture to Apple ProRes files for your post production work, with immediately useable H.264 files captured to off-the-shelf USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives for proxy workflows, streaming, review and approval and more.
 
Ki Pro Ultra 12G has been updated to offer a powerful 8K playback functionality. By utilizing 4x Ki Pro Ultra 12G units as well as RS-422 control to all four units, playback of 8K video is achieved as individual 4K quadrants. The correct 8K SDI VPID is implemented to ensure compatibility with downstream devices.For 4x HDMI playback is also an option for this workflow with the addition of a suitable HDMI 2.0 to HDMI 2.1 converter.

Ki Pro Ultra 12G lets you record edit-friendly Apple ProRes, Avid DNxHR and Avid DNxHD files directly to removable AJA PAK SSD Media. Once removed from the Ki Pro Ultra Plus 12G, the PAK can be inserted into the AJA PAK Dock Pro which connects directly to your computer via USB 3.2 Gen2 over USB-C, allowing you to rapidly transfer files that are ready for use immediately in your non-linear editing system.
 
The reinforced connector is engineered for repeated insertion and removal cycles, unlike the connector built into SSD drives, which is designed primarily to be inserted into a computer and rarely removed.
 
There are four PAK Media sizes available offering a balance between price and long recording needs and you may order the media as preformatted in either HFS+ or exFAT for fast deployment upon arrival.
 
PAK Dock Pro is an external dock for use with AJA PAK media. PAK Dock Pro utilizes a USB 3.2 Gen2 port for high speed transfer of recorded media files to a host computer. PAK Dock Pro is bus-powered, meaning that a single USB-C cable enables file transfer and also powers the unit.
 
Ki Pro Ultra 12G offers dual power inputs which allows power redundancy support in the field. Simply connect two power supplies and should one source fail, the other automatically provides power. Ki Pro Ultra 12G ships with one included KPU-Power-Supply.
 
I am totally befuddled with the MyCloud ex2 ultra not being seen on my two roku ultras. Interestingly my much older WdMycloud is totally visible and accessible. The new EXUlta is supposed to be DLNA compliment. There is a button for media server on the old device. I cannot find that button anywhere on the setting for the new Ex2 Ultra. I am not getting a helpful answer for phone support. Other then here are apps you can download. My response to that is I did not need to do that with the old WdMycloud. So if anyone has made the two device work together any help would be much appreciated. Thanks. I would be up and running instead of searching for help. If the media switch were returned. Thanks much
 
Thank you. So Twonky was the media server software in Os3 then. This is good to know. A page a level for two way from your shared link may help me bettter configure Twonky on my WD Elite dashboard. That will be tomorrow. I still would tike learn the reason it was not included in Os5. If to had been it would have saved days of going between various tech people at WD and other places to resolve the issue. I i will not even mention the return of A WDHome in that mix of the upgrade. The feature certainly should be replaced with a firmware update. My reading at community would suggest many are unhappy. All that being g said thanks for the link. It is much appreciated.
 
The fact that that this customer and others are trying to figure out all the holes in Os5 will most hopefully be noticed somewhere in redoing Os5 to make the operating system more user friendly. I am an old retired guy with time on my hands. Somewhere in engineering must be employed to establish quality. I hope the word gets to that group. My next step will be to see wether I can access the drive through the mac iOS 5 app away from my network. I must say that when speaking with phone support one tech actually was convinced the media tab slider existed in Os5.
 
I got my to work by installing twonky. However it required a lot of digging to get it to work. I installed the twonky app via apps in the dashboard toolbar. You then need to configure. Pressing that button/bar leads to configure. This will open twonky and then you need to share the folder. /mnt leaving the choice at the other end open to all. In roku media player you have to hit \* help and search for DLNA devices. Give it sometime but it will be seen. It is absolutely clumsy. I seem to have lost the ability to search on the drives tho. It is pretty clear OS5 was not completely and thoroughly tested. I did find out twonky is what was used inside of OS3 that made it so much easier to use.
 
Roku's are primarily designed for Internet streaming. The Media player is rather basic and mainly designed for people to show pictures and movies from a single USB stick. If you want to get into complicated h
