Throw in a global pandemic that drove costs through the roof and extended lead time on materials, and it took us until this past year to save up the $5,000 we expected to spend for finishing the unfinished attic and remodeling our primary bathroom.

For example, we had put a pair of wet-rated sconces above our bathroom vanity, right next to the shower. While on paper it looked fine but once everything was roughed in it looked WAY too cramped. We were also nervous about light fixtures right next to the shower.
 
This phase is also the quickest phase of them all. During the planning phase, I also plan out all the final touches and accessories that I need for the space and order those when I place the big materials order.
 
Now with the entire process planned out and a schedule in hand, into the planner it goes. You know the saying. What can be done anytime is done at no time. I know that if I prioritize the master bathroom project, and schedule it out, it will get done!

The Louvre is carrying out some major maintenance and renovation work to make the visitor experience as comfortable and positive as possible. As a result, some of the museum rooms have to be periodically closed. In addition, some rooms may need to be closed for weather-related reasons.

1. **Mold, asbestos, and/or lead**: If these toxins are discovered (ideally in a test before work has begun), you will have to hire a qualified abatement company to safely remove them. You will also need to vacate the premises until the matter is resolved.
 
Change orders are addendums to your original renovation contract that account for any additions or other deviations in the work. They can be instigated by you or your contractor or architect at any time and require your ultimate sign-off.
 
Change orders often arise because contractors underestimate the scope or overlook details of the project during the planning phase. (Sad to say that some contractors will deliberately omit items from their proposals for a lower bid.) Or they based their bids on incomplete drawings or erroneous designs by the architect.
 
Other times change orders are needed to address defects in the building that either should have been or were not able to be discovered before the work began and walls came down. This usually involves plumbing, electrical, or mechanical systems as well as foundational problems in a brownstone.
 
There are plenty of times when you (the client) will initiate a change order. Maybe you held off on making certain decisions or choosing materials early on, or have a change of heart about one aspect or another (like switching from a pre-fab Corian countertop to a custom marble one).
 
Given the inevitability of changes, your contract should specify a process for submitting and approving change orders--for example, that your contractor will provide a description of what the new work will cost and how it will impact the schedule, and that you must approve in writing. (Your contract should also state whether that can be by text, email, or only pen and ink.)
 
No matter how carefully and competently your renovation was planned, designed, and executed, there are bound to be items that require attention before the final sign-off and final payment. Be sure to try all the drawers and doors, look closely at the edges and finishes, and make sure everything is working the way it should.
 
The punch list is a tool that allows your contractor to keep track of all the bits and pieces of the job that need to be completed. By tying it to the final payment, it also serves as a financial incentive for your contractor to tie up all the loose ends.
 
**Tips for getting your punch list done**  
The worst thing you can do is wait until the end of your project to hand over your list. By that time, your contractor probably has another project on the schedule and is expected elsewhere.
 
For smaller jobs, you may need more of an incentive for the contractor to tackle everything. In those cases you could withhold 15 percent and then pay that out in two installments while the punch list is being completed. This is a fairly standard practice in the industry and should be set out in the 'hold-back' provision in your contract.
 
Simply put, a C of O is a document that lays out a building's legal use and occupancy. In a residential building, that includes how many bedrooms or exits are allowed at that address. Without an up-to-date C of O, no one can legally occupy a building, so you run the risk of the city issuing a vacate order. It can also complicate matters when you try and sell your property. Usually any C of O problem will surface in the title search, and a potential buyer may walk away if they think the situation will take too long to correct.
 
As you begin the planning phase of your project, it is important to build trusting relationships with key partners, like your Project Developer and the design team. A good contractor will want you, as the homeowner, to understand the partnership is a relationship rather than a transaction and that you will be involved in every step along the way.
 
If you choose to work with a design-build firm, they are a one-stop-shop for your entire home renovation process. During the design phase of the project, you will see three or four key steps, most beginning with a schematic design.
 
1. Communication Preferences: At Better Builders, we like to kick off the design phase by providing a free DiSC assessment. We use the DiSC profile to assess your preferred communication style. This assessment helps our team to better guide you through the overall process.
 
Construction Agreement: Once the agreement has been signed and a deposit has been made, the wheels are set in motion for the transition from design to production, which includes internal and external handoff of the project.
 
The external handoff consists of the project developer and production project manager assigned to the project. These team members meet onsite for formal introductions to the homeowner and perform an onsite walkthrough of the project. This is the passing of the baton between project development and production.
 
A responsible builder will begin the handoff discussion by explaining any intricacies of the job that need to be highlighted to the production team. This instills trust between the homeowner and the production team.
 
As the production team gears up for construction to begin, they launch into a detailed preparation stage. This is where the schedule is written, long-lead time items are ordered, and site preparation begins.
 
Part of the project management schedule is getting trade partners' buy-in to the project and timeline. These relationships are why trusted and experienced contractors can offer fixed prices to clients and still be sustainable in their business because the process is extremely efficient and does not leave gaps between each step.
 
While most builders can provide an estimated average project timeline, it is important to remember that many variables may impact the duration of your build. Below are some common project types and estimates of the average construction duration:
 
Doing all of this detailed preparation right takes time. A good contractor will have a documented methodical process and will help you to set your expectations of the timeline and tell you to enter the process with patience. You should look for a contractor that always acts as a trusted advisor and guides you through the process with consistency and care.
 
Home renovation and custom home building have been a part of my life since birth. My great-grandfather, grandfather, and father were all Carpenters. It was only natural for me to be drawn to it as well. I worked as a Carpenter and Project lead helping him create and produce many extraordinary projects. My experiences have varied from Carpenter, Lead Carpenter, Project Manager, Production Manager, Project Developer, and Sales Manager. I started with Better Builders in 2011 and, in 2019, became an owner.
 
Better Builders manages new construction and residential remodeling projects throughout Seattle and the Greater Puget Sound Area, including: Alki, Ballard, Bellevue, Bothell, Burien, Carnation, Clyde Hill, Des Moines, Duvall, Fall City, Federal Way, Issaquah, Kenmore, Kent, Kirkland, Lake Forest Park, Medina, Mercer Island, Newcastle, Normandy Park, North Bend, Redmond, Renton, Sammamish, Shoreline, and Woodinville.
 
By default, Renovate bot runs as often as its administrator has configured it to (e.g. hourly, daily, etc.).The exact frequency at which Renovate can process individual repositories depends on the combination of how often it runs, how many repositories are installed, and whether there's a lot of work to be done in each repository (e.g. if a commonly used dependency has recently gotten a new update, which triggers a lot of PRs to be created).
 
While as an end user you may think of scheduling in terms of when you allow it to raise updates, it's important to remember that such updates can only occur if the bot gets the opportunity to run within the schedule window you provide.
