The following Stock Firmware is the mobile operating system (OS) version that comes pre-installed on a device. It is the version of the OS provided by the device manufacturer and is typically the most stable version. The device manufacturer usually updates the stock firmware to fix bugs and add new features.
 
The s905w2 is a new cpu from amlogic. As far as I know no one has tried to get mainline linux running on tv boxes containing that cpu Generally when a manufacturer comes out with a new cpu it takes the main line linux community a couple of years to get a stable system working on it (if there is enough community support). So I would suggest you use your box as an android box and come back in a year or so to see if there has been any movement to support this cpu. Or if you have the skills work on bringing support for the cpu into mainline linux.

On my Github page I have a Debian and Ubuntu image containing a mainline compatible DTB for the S905W2. Everything works to create a headless Linux server. But there is no HDMI or sound yet unfortunately.
 
Especially the wifi modules are a lottery. So you have to be lucky to get a standard supported wifi module. And otherwise you'll have to learn a lot, google a lot to get wifi working. That's the 'fun' of tinkering with those cheap boxes. If you want a working wifi and don't want to learn all that... you are better of buying a well supported SBC instead.
 
I would expect the sp6330 to work... You could try to install the full firmware package via apt-get install firmware-linux. If that doesn't work you could try to see if dmesg complains about something...

CNXSoft: Bear in mind that there are multiple versions of Nexbox A95X. Yesterday, I published the review of Nexbox A95X with Android 6.0, with the model based on Amlogic S905X processor. In this article, Karl had a look at Nexbox A95X with Amlogic S905 processor, which he purchased a couple of months ago, but since he was not happy with the Android 5.1 firmware, he decided to customize it.
 
Below is the main software that I use. If you know any other alternatives please leave a comment. Especially Beyond Compare only 30 day evaluation. It is not too expensive and I use it for other things. Install all the programs below with defaults and it should work except the Customization Tool. Install it to someplace other than Program Files. It will save button presses when needing elevated privileges.
 
I will be going to go over the basics of this tool. When you first load the tool it will be in Chinese. The 2nd menu Item in the top will set it to English, and it will remember it the rest of the time.
 
The first step is to unpack the img files. Press the load button, and you will be prompted to what you want to unpack. I check them all at this point except the bottom one. There is an issue right now with the tool with the last one. Then choose the img we are porting to. This will take a while.
 
Ok I got it working, But not right, In the tronsmart rom it just boots up, some apps are installed and others appear when they feel like it, Why does it install this way, On the NEXBOX-A95X.img rom it actually has a pre install screen during boot and everything gets installed before its finished booting.
 
I found my problem, If you have an app named like this ( Advanced Task Manager.apk ) It will not install.
But if you rename it to ( Taskmanager.apk ) It installs just fine. How hard would it be to make the tronsmart rom install on first boot, Seems this can take a few reboots for everything to show up.
 
Ohh yes spaces will stop it. If you are patient it should install them all on first boot. Might take a bit depending on how many and how big they are. Depends in launcher as well. You could script a reboot in that runs once in the preinstall script so you know when it is done.
 
I have been trying to flash this firmware with he usb burning tool however either my a95x is not detected by windows when in recovery or when it is connected to the pc, i press the recovery button, it sits at the a95x boot screen screen and is detected but fails with send command/usb control setup error
 
The drivers are installed when you install the Amlogic USB Burn Tool, Pay attention when you install it you well get a separate window that opens up for the driver install, Here is a link to the latest USB Burn Tool.
 
**Anthony Staunton :**
Not sure if this will do all that you require from Beyond Compare, but WinMerge can compare files/folders for you and is open source. Maybe it can replace BC for you.

 
Once again I am using the Amlogic Firmware Customization Tool, It is for windows, It has everything it needs built into it, I built another custom firmware just last night for the A95X, Did not loose root, All you need with this tool is the java development kit, For some reason it just wont work with the Tronsmart ported firmware, No biggie the new update runs better anyways.

@Mychance 
Yup requires Type A to Type A cable. You can purchase online or make them. I sacrificed 2 cables connected the colors and have flashed with it over a hundred times without issues.
 
Thanks for the answer ? I kinda have such a cable I got with a cheap external HDD but I am wondering if there is a special wiring like we have with the crossover ethernet cables. Am I gonna brick the box if the wires are crossed ?

@Richard 
This may require compiling drivers for Bluetooth drivers, and/or modifying the Android firmware, which may or may not require Amlogic Android SDK. Better ask on Freaktab in case somebody managed to do it.
 
Does anyone have a update zip firmware download link for the a95x s905x 2g/16g without reset button?
I cannot reboot to boot loader and cannot get the box recognized properly by PC to use amlogic usb burning tool. The box is detected and disconnects intermittently. Thanks
 
i know this is a bit off topic but i have been trying to modify a rom for an x9 android box. and as i have done many times in the past with android lolipop, but after saving the image file in customization tool, and flashing to the box, it boots into revovery. even if i simply modify the boot animation, same results. and crazy enough even without any modification to the rom, i simply pack it and try and flash it and my box only boots into recovery. i am totally frustrated. can anyone provide any help?
 
My App Folder looks like this: CaptivePortalLogin, CertInstaller, KeyChain, LatinIME, PackageInstaller, PacProcessor, superuser, webview
Priv-app Folder: DefaultContainerService, DownloadProvider, droidlogic-res, ExternalStorageProvider, InputDevices, MediaProvider, Settings, SettingsProvider, Shell, TvSettings
 
If it is a streaming App, it is very likely, that there is a kodi plugin for it. VideoLan player, MxPlayer all have issues sometimes with high bitrate or 4K videos, the best way to play videos and streams is to get rid of android and install openelec! It is supertiny, smooth and plays everything like a charm. -2347.html
 
I really liked this custom rom, it got faster. But it should have rom x32 because 1gb of ram compli
