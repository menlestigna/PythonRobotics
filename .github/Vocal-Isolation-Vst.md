In 2016, our journey to create the ultimate online AI vocal remover and karaoke generator kicked off. With significant investmentsin high-performance GPUs and machine learning techniques, PhonicMind has continuously refined its algorithms.
 
FBy 2017, we had unveiled the industry's first AI-based online vocal and voice remover.But we didn't stop there. Focused on becoming the industry standard, we've leveraged user-generated karaoke,acapella, and instrumental tracks to train our AI for even higher performance.

As of 2019, PhonicMind transformed once more, now providing professional-grade isolation ofvocals, drums, bass, and other instruments.Today, we continue to set the benchmark for AI vocal removal and music extraction quality.
 
PhonicMind simplifies the process of removing vocals and creating karaoke tracks. Beyond vocal isolation,our AI technology also allows you to separate drums, bass, and other musical elements for your unique audio compositions.
 
I had NO idea that Logic Pro (ver 10.7.7 on Ventura 13.3.1) had this really quite effective VOICE ISOLATION plugin stuffed down in the APPLE AU bin! Take a listen! It's good! (and very similar to the voice isolation that recently was added to Final Cut Pro). Funny that there was almost no mention of this whenever Apple added it to Logic Pro sometime in the last year or so. ? But glad it's there!
 
The Apple AU's are not part of Logic, they are part of macOS - specifically, I don't have that one on Monterey, so it's presumably an AU that's been added in Ventura. You can use them in any app that supports AudioUnits, other DAWs, Audio Hijack, etc...
 
Ah! That makes sense! In my mind Logic IS Apple, but you are correct... thanks for clarifying that. In any event, it is a nice feature for those of us who have to interview folks in less than perfect conditions! ?
 
When there is background music or noise, when you press the "voice isolation" option in Davinci, the program does a great job of removing the noise and music. Does anyone know if premiere has the same tool? and how is it used?
 
When I'm in Davinci and I have a video of a person talking and I want to remove the background music, I just turn on Voice Isolation and the music almost disappears completely. What steps do I have to follow to do the same in Premiere? Most of the time I need to remove background music, because I edit funny twitch videos.

Our web tool, driven by cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, in just a few clicks, dissects audio into individual components with extreme accuracy. From vocals to instruments, beats to basslines, uncover hidden layers with our free stem separation tool.
 
Using Voice.ai's Stem Splitter is super easy! Upload your audio file, select the elements you wish to isolate (vocals, instruments, beats, or basslines), and let it work its magic. In moments, you'll have the extracted components, granting you creative control to do whatever you want afterward.
 
Voice.ai's Stem Splitter guarantees precision and consistent results on any audio file, from music tracks to podcasts, soundscapes, and live recordings. With zero costs, it's the ultimate choice for unlocking creative freedom and elevating audio projects.
 
This audio effect improves quality of voice sound and I think that audio noise is removed either. This is AI audio effect. This effect improves quality of voice sound to be much clear and better audible.
 
I am 42. I have been creating videos since 2009 (the date when my first daughter was born in). My first video software was Pinnacle, next one was Sony Vegas 8 (I am not sure if remember it correctly). I am also a developer and wedding movie operator and editor. For example: I have created an Android app which let me control Vegas Pro rendering progress level on Android smartphone. I created it for fun, because I also love programming. I also created my own plugin for Audio To Text feature specified usage from Vegas Pro 19. I created proxy creation plugin which uses multiple GPU threads (maximum 3) to create proxy files for Vegas Pro. I also written many others plugin/softwares which enhance my video editing, also wedding editing.
 
There is no native Vegas Pro audio FX that can do voice isolation in a similar way as far as I am aware - most of VP's audio FX have been around for a decade or more (though the ExpressFX ones are more recent).
 
Steinberg have just released SpectraLayers Pro 10 that comes with giant leaps forward in unmixing using AI. Unmix options include unmixing noisy speech and unmixing multiple voices. Have a look at SpectraLayers Pro 10's webpage for more information - -features/ - and check out the demos attached to each feature's listing.
 
SL10's developer advised on SpectraLayer's forum about a week ago that the first update to SL10 (to be released next week) includes GPU unmix assistance thus enormously speeding up unmix processing. From another SL forum thread, apparently GPU assistance with unmixing noisy speech will come with the 2nd update later this year.
 
SpectraLayers Pro 10 (the version which has unmixing) is not inexpensive but is much lower in cost than iZotope's RX Advanced which has its own version of voice isolation. Further, crossgrading to SpectraLayers from RX5 or above (Standard or Advanced) as well as from Adobe Audition comes with a discounted price.
 
In the Resolve example, I missed the distorted 'after' so actually I probably should have allowed more noise in an attempt to have a non distored 'after'. With RN noise suppression I allowed a lot more noise then I would have wished but still the Voice is distorted. It may have a use in limited noisy circumstances
 
SpectraLayers Pro (SLP) used to have a full functioning 30-day trial, I do not know if the trial is still available. Otherwise SLP is my go-to app for restoration. Not exactly a budget item, but lower cost than iZ's RX 10 Adv. (which is also good).
 
The trial for SpectraLayers 10 will be available next week. Meanwhile, you can check this page comparing SpectraLayers 10, RX 10.4, Acoustica 7.4 and Clarity Vx 14 on different denoising/restoration tasks : -Comparison/
 
@marcinzm Resolve Voice Isolation does a really good job of eliminating wind noise. That's what I use it for. There's no effect in Vegas 20 that can do as good a job. For some other types of sounds that Resolve doesn't handle well, I use Adobe Audition Sound Removal or Noise Removal.
 
Audo . ai allows 20 minutes of audio processing each month using AI. The demo is pretty incredible, I've used it a couple of times with good result, but not as good as the demo. It's not inside Vegas, you upload your audio, download the processed version and manually replace on timeline.
 
Vegas isn't using AI for audio... Yet... But some really cool video tools are coming soon, stuff that goes beyond the AI tools already present, and is useful to everyone. You'll hear more about that in the very near future.
 
I have a space which has recently become available to me:
The space is a spare BR in my house. Dimensions are 8'W x 9'L x 7'.5"/7.7"high ), and I'm wondering if it might be more beneficial to build an actual vocal booth within this room, or, would it be better to alter the existing room, turning the room itself into a booth, which would include altering existing construction and materials that are already in place.
 
The walls are not parallel. They vary as much as 2" on the ends of each, including the ceiling, which has a slight canter that results in the ceiling being lower by almost 2" (1 & 7/8 to be precise) on one end.
 
I'm looking for a good level of isolation, I don't want to half-ass this. I'm more concerned with noise from the outside getting in than I am sound getting out, although, if one is treated, then so is the other, right? This noise could be anything from birds chirping to a heavy rain storm, or, the occasional truck going by.
 
It's only necessary that the space be big enough to accommodate one vocalist comfortably, although if you decide that using the entire room would be better, I could easily - comfortably - fit 4 vocalists.
 
Acoustic treatment methods within the space are of course a concern. But my main question at this point is: which would be more effective and cost efficient? Reconstructing**the room** for this use, or, building **a separate vocal booth** that would be placed inside this room?
 
If you got 2 grand build a booth, if you got 10, do the whole room. If you got 500, keep saving man. A couple of canare wire lengths and switch craft connectors is gonna cost like $80 if you make them yourself. That's 1/5 of the projected budget. See where I'm heading w this? I'm curious to see what the other guys say, but that's my thought on it. At $20-100+ per sqf, $500 doesn't go to far with studio construction. It's roughly $25 for a 5lb box of screws. And $75 for a basic solid core door, slab, no frame. That's about a third of the projected budget. Just for cable, a door,and screws.
 
A 'experinced drywall professional' who's "built studios before" built booths I tore down, and re built. The one booth the owner decided to keep shared a common hollow wooden deck on concrete, with the control room. The CR rear wall(s) assembly houses an ac and the inner wall leaf transmits floor vibration into LDCs in the booth. The booth is a great storage closet :) and unfortunately was the larger of the three in the studio.
 
But I would say as well, use the entire room. 70 year old houses are often elevated wood framing...that is gonna be your weakest link, sight unseen. The window will require you to develop a window plug that matches as much as possible the existing wall assembly.
