You need to understand that the more androgens in your system, for 99% of people, will equate to more body hair growth, facial hair growth, everywhere hair growth, EXCEPT for the hair on top of your head.

When it comes to male hormones and androgens, even if androgens promote body hair growth, the more body hair growth you experience will in almost all cases also mean more hair loss on your head in parallel.
 
If you're a human, you can't just haphazardly use performance-enhancing androgens and assume that you're going to be hair loss free, because that's not how it works in almost all cases unless you are a genetic elite who is immune to androgenic alopecia (90-99% aren't).
 
Even disregarding exogenous hormones entirely, 9/10 men will experience very noticeable diffuse thinning and recession in their lifetime just as a result of their natural endogenous hormone production.

They did produce very small amounts of Testosterone, and consequently DHT as a result of production in the adrenal glands, but it wasn't in significant enough quantities to facilitate normal development during puberty, or androgenic alopecia.
 
While this isn't significant enough to prevent a severely balding male from regrowing his hair almost entirely via pharmacology and hormone manipulation, the data still suggests some level of irreversibility.
 
If you're going to be using supraphysiological amounts of androgens, or even simply walk around with your normal endogenous androgen production and you care about the hair on your head, then you should establish a hair loss prevention regimen that addresses and protects you from both testosterone and DHT.
 
The 2018-2027 Wild Turkey Management Plan (PDF) focuses on developing population models for each wildlife management unit (WMU). The models will predict turkey population responses to changes in harvest regulations and help identify optimal harvest regulations to maximize both turkey populations and hunter opportunities. Increasing habitat and assessing turkey diseases and hunter participation are also priorities. Implementation schedule for turkey management plan for Pennsylvania, 2018-2027 (PDF)

 
**I.** **Why is that turkey all alone?** ****The wild turkey species is, by nature, a flocking and social species. Being such, flocks maintain home ranges and recognize individual animals within each flock. They establish a 'pecking order' (like chickens) with dominant and subordinate individuals. Dominant individuals will peck at or chase subordinates, especially away from food sources.
There are two possibilities (or a combination) for this lone hen. 1) She is a subordinate, and cannot compete in the pecking order of the flock. Instead of constantly being suppressed, she has chosen to interact no longer with the flock and to survive on her own. 2) She is an old hen that has been barren for a few years (did not successfully raise a brood, or did not attempt to lay eggs due to age), and, being without poults, she has no incentive to socialize (join a flock of other hens without broods). Barren hens typically flock with others without broods, whereas hens with young will form their own flock. Being an older hen, the other cohorts from her original flock may have all died. Often it is difficult for an unrecognized adult individual to join another flock. Wild hen turkeys typically can survive in the wild to 5 or 6 years old.
 
(Information provided by Bob Eriksen, NWTF Conservation Field Supervisor, Northeastern US): The origin of all domestic varieties is the Mexican wild turkey (Meleagris gallapavo gallapavo). Selective breeding in Europe after the Spanish brought domestic birds to that continent resulted in a number of breeds with different characteristics. The bronze variety actually originated in North America in the 1800's by breeders crossing wild and domestic stock to obtain the darker colors and metallic iridescence. There is a good summary of domestic turkey varieties on Wikipedia with good photos. There are a number of recognized standard breeds. Among them are: broad-breasted white, broad-breasted bronze, standard bronze, Royal Palm, Black or Spanish black, slate or blue slate, Bourbon Red, Narragansett, chocolate, Beltsville white and midget white.
 
(Information provided by Bob Eriksen, NWTF Conservation Field Supervisor, Northeastern US): The standard bronze does not have the "double-wide" breast of the broad-breasted varieties. Most bronze turkeys exhibit domestic traits such as heavier legs than wild birds, lighter leg color than wild birds (very light pink to gray or white), light cream colored to white tips on the retrices (major tail feathers) and upper and lower tail coverts. In addition the heads of both sexes are usually more heavily ornamented than wild birds. Very large major caruncles, heavy snoods and crowns and large dewlaps are typical. Broad-breasted bronze turkeys are too heavy to breed naturally and must be artificially inseminated unless young toms are used for breeding. The standard bronze is lighter and can breed naturally but it is still heavier at younger ages than wild birds.
 
The white hen is probably a color phase known as the smoky-gray. From a distance, these birds appear to be white, though they are not albino. They have dark eyes and normal-colored legs. Up close you can actually see all the colors of the typical eastern wild turkey. However, the colors are muted or ghost-like, making the bird appear white or light gray. This color phase is a recessive trait and it is likely that the bird's mother was a typically colored wild turkey. However, both her mother and her father had a recessive gene for this color phase. So, it is likely that the offspring of the light colored hen would be of typical color. She would have to mate with a gobbler that had the recessive trait in order to produce white poults and the chances of that happening are pretty slim.
 
Turkey beards are specialized structures of the skin that arise from a raised area of skin called a papilla. While all hens have a papilla, only around 10 percent (1 to 29 percent, depending on the population) actually have a beard. Hen beards tend to be shorter and thinner than gobbler beards. Bearded hens are able to reproduce successfully.
 
Typically, turkey beards are dark gray or black in color. Sometimes hunters note a white residue on the beard. This residue is a waxy substance that adheres to the bristles as the beard grows out of the papilla. It is usually confined to the first few inches of the beard. Lighter colors are sometimes seen on other portions of the beard. The most common are bands of amber (orange) or blond across the beard horizontally. These light colors are likely areas of less melanin, the dark pigment that colors the beard. The lack of melanin may be a dietary deficiency or it may be inherited. In any case, the lighter colors indicate areas of weakness in the beard that may be more likely to break off. On occasion the whole beard will be blond or amber in color.
 
The white barring or markings on the central tail feathers of a gobbler occurs with some regularity on adult gobblers. It is estimated that about 10 percent of gobblers exhibit this kind of barring on their central tail feathers. The white barring is usually confined to the central two or three pairs of retrices or major tail feathers. This odd coloration is sometimes observed on jakes and occasionally noted in adult hens. It is not restricted to eastern wild turkeys. Biologists have noted white barring on the central tail feathers of Merriams turkeys, Rio Grande wild turkeys and the Florida or Osceola subspecies, too.
 
Biologists theorize that this coloration may be caused by a dietary deficiency. Poultry experts have documented feather color abnormalities in domestic fowl and traced those abnormalities to vitamin deficiency. A dietary deficiency may be associated with the condition of the wild turkey when those feathers are growing. The central tail feathers are molted in mid-summer when many other feathers are being replaced. The demand for nutrients to grow feathers may exceed the availability of those nutrients when the molt is occurring in some birds or in certain years resulting in the barring of the tail feathers.
 
Not typically in Pennsylvania - The Pennsylvania Game Commission has not documented any severe turkey winter mortaility since the three consecutive severe winters of 1976-78. Possible disease transmission from concentrated feeding sites.
 
The Pennsylvania Game Commission has a policy of no winter feeding of wildlife. The Game Commission used to have a winter feeding program, but abandoned it because it is ineffective and impractical, and scientific studies of winter feeding programs are almost universal in pointing out the large numbers of disadvantages as opposed to a very few advantages.
 
(In 1997, a Game Commission intern, Raymond Hixson, developed a report on winter feeding of deer and turkeys, and I will provide the highlights on turkeys.) Turkeys, like deer and other wildlife that are active during winter, have adaptations that help their survival. Fat tissues comprise 25 percent of winter body weights in adult turkeys and 15 percent in juveniles. The increased winter fat serves as an energy reserve and as added insulation, thereby improving survival. Body weight losses of 35 percent in adult wild turkeys and 25 percent in juveniles can result in death, although some wild turkeys may lose a third of their body weight without any devastating effects. Adults have a survival edge over juvenile birds due to greater adipose and muscle tissue reserves. Turkey hens survive longer than males when exposed to severe cold in fasting conditions. Although males may have greater fat reserves, females need relatively less food.
