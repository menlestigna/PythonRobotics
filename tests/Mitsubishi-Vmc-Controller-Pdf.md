Then I setup Kepware configuration and PLC program under the help of Mitsubishi Ethernet Driver Help, there have some contents about Q and QnA series PLC, but I can't connect to M80 and M70 controller successfully.
 
Unfortunately, Kepware does not currently have a solution for communicating with M80/M70 series directly. An alternative solution would be to use a Q Series PLC as a gateway to the M80/M70 series devices. Please submit a case as described in the following link; if you would like to see if the functionality of a direct connection can be added to future releases of KEPServerEX:
 
Our AE200 Mitsubishi Electric centralised controller offers a large 10.4 inch touch screen display with easy control making programming a breeze, giving you control of temperature, fan speed and airflow options at the touch of a button.
 
Our air conditioning systems are supported by a multitude of remote controllers. Each remote controller type, whilst being able to support the general control and monitoring functions for a group of indoor units, can also offer other unique operational features.

Mitsubishi Electric has a vast product range that includes VRF air conditioning and chillers. Our Product Catalogue has our complete range of current products, including technical specification, so for more information please download this.
 
Mitsubishi Electric offers solutions that deliver the quality and excellence you would expect from a world-leading supplier. We can support you every step of the way whether pre-sales design and specification, installation and commissioning, or service and maintenance, right through to recycling.
 
To avoid wasting your time on this question, you might only want to react on this if you have knowledge of industrial robotic arms specific.Common troubleshooting is unlikely to fix this problem or could take too much time.
 
We did replace the batteries of both the robot and the controller. As it took some time to get the batteries delivered, we've left the robot (and controller) withouth power for the weekend. (Which might have caused this problem)
 
All the steps are actually correct there- accept, when you press RESET, you curt need to select yourRobot type, I usually just keep pressing RESET till I get USER, then press start & only then it displaysramclr or something
 
The Audi question was a legit query. I also have my RB34 Navara with Thunder as well, wanted to see if I could make that work.We do not have the Lancer here, so parts for the S14 were brought in from NZ. I only got the one controller.
 
I have a chargecooler, so want the fan always running to maintain airflow over the chargecooler radiator, but when sitting with a cold engine, making configuration changes etc, I have the top row to keep the fans off. You could do something similar with your top row at 69 degrees, for example, and that'll keep it off until the ECT reaches 70. You could do the same with the leftmost column for RPM.
 
Ive stuck with my plain little table and it is working well. As Adam mentioned above, it was as simple as getting the ETC "greater/lesser than" setting correct. A sly little setting was the 50deg C ETC threshold I put in, would run the fans from cold until 50 deg, switch off and then start following the table data I had set. Put this to 0 deg and sorted.
 
At temperature all is fine but for the control module going into thermal protection and shutting down. Disconnecting one of the two fans sorts that out. I shall get a Nissan Infinity module, same as Lancer locally and run two units.
 
Is the PWM ecu out impedance critical? As in can I series connect on PWM Aux to both controllers ? Cannot get my head around that one yet. But yea, very pleased with the effort and thanks to all for the help. :-)
 
Have you positioned the controller in the airflow? On the Galant/Legnum VR-4 I took mine from, it was mounted behind the fans, which I guess is to help with preventing the thermal shutdown with the higher load.
 
I took a quick look at those links you provided, both the old openhab binding and the HASS stuff. It appears that they both communicate with the aircon using UDP, which is completely different to how the Daikin binding communicates with the daikin controller (via tcp/ http(s)).
 
The Mitsubishi MHK2 is the second revision of Mitsubishi's most popular wireless controller set, now available for M & P Series residential and light commercial units. This controller offers in-depth 7-day scheduling and an easy to read, backlit display.
 
The MRCH2 is the main body of the thermostat. This can be placed anywhere within 200 feet of the indoor unit and does not require line of sight. The ;MRC2 cable will connect to the CN105 connector on the indoor unit's control board. The other end of this cable will connect to the MIFH2 receiver. The MIFH2 should be placed on the right side of a wall mounted unit, in the pocket of a MLZ-KP cassette, or anywhere near the control side of a ducted or square cassette unit.

The full colour touch controller PAR-CT01MAA enables the control of both residential and commercial air conditioning applications. It has a customisable 3.5 inch colour LCD touch panel that makes it easy to use. Available in white or premium black finishes, suitable for any dcor.
 
Big visible-sized icons on the full colour 3.5 inch touch panel display. Operation panels are easier to see and simple to use. Logo images can also be displayed on the initial screen for a more customised and user-friendly experience.
 
180 colour patterns can be selected for control parameters or background on the display. Users can also customise the panel to display the selected paramaters only, for e.g. Hotels can choose to only display the basic settings of ON/OFF, set temp., fan speed etc.
 
The initial setup (selecting function parameters) can now be performed in advance on a smartphone, with the settings transmitted to the remote controller by enabling BLE transmission upon entry to the room.
 
I'm having trouble connecting a Q-series MELSEC PLC to my local 8.1 gateway. I have the Mitsubishi TCP module and I've specified the device's IP, used the default port, and I've given the IP address of my network adapter to be used to connect to it.
 
I'm connected through a small unmanaged switch between my PC and the built in ethernet port on the controller (Q03UDV). I'm not too used to using Mitsubishi PLCs either, which certainly doesn't help me
 
I'm going to double check today, but I had left GXWorks2 online with the device after creating that module, so I think it was taking that port and preventing the gateway from connecting. Once I power cycled, Igntion got the port and then I was unable to go online with it in GXWorks, so I'll probably just need to add a second module with another port that my project editor can use
 
CC-Link IE Field Basic is a protocol designed to integrate Ethernet devices into a Mitsubishi Automation Controller. As opposed to the existing SLMP (MC Protocol), the Mitsubishi automation controllers act as the master, driving the communications to the slave devices over standard UDP messaging. The communications support 64 bits and 32 16-bit words of data per station in each direction, with each slave supporting 4 stations. The data is mapped into controller memory through the Mitsubishi setup tools (GXWorks 2/3).
 
The Mitsubishi PAR-40MAAU is the fourth version of the company's most popular wired controller. It is specifically designed for residential and light commercial M & P Series units. This controller has advanced features, including in-depth 7-day scheduling and a backlit display, making it easier to read and use.
 
Having installed many heat pumps over the last 15 years, my preference because Mitsubishi Ecodan units for the built quality and the connectivity with bespoke system. I had a W85 on my last house and having recently moved house, I went for the same arrangement, a Mitsubishi Ecodan W85 with a FTC6. Ive fitted a fair few of these units over the last 10 years and for the first time ever, I have a issue with the one I am fitting to my house. I can not for the life of me get the remote controller to power up. Ive changed the wiring 3 times, move the controller from the preferred location to directly adjacent to the FTC6 panel with several inches of cable between them, played with the dip-switches and still nothing. 

I want to make sure I am not going mad before I go back to Mitsubishi with my issue because I've never had a installation issue with any Mitsubishi kit before. 

Items tested, checked and replaced; connecting cable replace, connecting cable relocated(in the case in interference), controller replaced, dip-switches moved on and off several times. No voltage on the controller connections but I am not sure what if any voltage I would see as the book appears to not pr
