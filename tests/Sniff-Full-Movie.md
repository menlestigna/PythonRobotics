Speaking of running freely, Red Dog pulled or tweaked something a few days ago so we had to keep her quiet and on pain meds. She recovered quickly and when I finally let her run this weekend, she did not stop (except to sniff!) for about 45 minutes. The 12-year old GSP that we met on the walk quickly decided against trying to keep up. ?

It can be hard to know what to do. We both need exercise, but if we take 45 minutes to get around one suburban block, because one member of the party can get lost in a sniffing location for two full minutes, neither of us gets any exercise.
 
I have three dogs and live in an urban environment with few off leash areas apart from small dog parks. As one of my dogs has dog reactivity issues all our outings are on leash. Our walks have always been at their pace and we stop and sniff the pee mail whenever they want. I have only three rules for my dogs on these walks- no pulling, we wait til everyone is finished sniffing before moving on, and no eating of garbage.
 
First a non-dog comment for Mireille. When my mom developed Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, one of the first symptoms was loss of balance, along with incontinence and some dementia-like symptoms. It was treated through a surgical procedure and she is now, at 83, doing great.
Now to the topic:
When I started going on sniffing walks with my dog, I noticed all sorts of wonderful things. She started peeing less often on walks. We lived in an urban area and some peeing on walks can be a sign of stress. I also noticed she was a bit less tense when we came upon another dog. I think the sniffing and more relaxed pace helped her to relax in general. And her intermittent limp, caused by an old injury to the psoas, got better. I believe this was due to her being able to move more naturally. For some dogs, just as for people, keeping up a swift pace at a walk or trot can cause repetitive motion injuries. Our dogs are not able to tell us they need to slow down or take a break. And as another person stated, the sniffing posture helps dogs stretch.
 
It takes months for an adult adopted dog to bond with its new family. We have seen it several times. We once adopted a large Munsterlander who thought he was going to get dumped every time we took him somewhere. He ended up a wonderfully loyal and affectionate dog, but it took him time.

For my students I suggest a quick 5 minute sniff multiple times during a structured walk (where quick obedience cues are thrown in) to keep the walk interesting for all involved. It also helps with proofing.
 
If the dog is nervous, I suggest a lot of sniff breaks. I use them heavily when working a shy or nervous dog. Temple Grandin went over sone research about it activating a different portion of the brain and reducing anxiety.
 
I too have seen dog parents pull their dogs away from the very thing that is a vital natural need for them to smell the world around them. They can smell amazing things such as the pea they r smelling came from a female or male.
 
I created a dog park that is primarily tall grass just for the dogs to sniff and I think it is cruel not to let dogs have their sniffing time. I think it goes along with the fact that most people want to get their dogs exercised as fast as possible and while that may get them physically tired how much fun is it for the dog.
 
Finally, the issue of rude dogs and inconsiderate owners, that is an issue of training and consideration not of people letting their dogs sniff. My pups do not bother other dogs or other people and if I see someone with a dog, heck if I see another person I call my pups to me and depending on where we are we may leave the path.
 
I am very, VERY careful when and where I let Sydney sniff. She is not a candidate for off-leash time, ever. At all. My oldest boy, Darwin, is better, and he gets quite a lot of leeway and sniff-breaks, while Seeker, the 9 month-old baby, unfortunately appears to be taking after his big sister in the sniff-and-eat department. No detached squirrel tails yet, though.
 
Out of curiosity one day I put her on the leash and let her go wherever her nose led her. She led us across a 6-lane highway (!) and then straight to the kitchen door and dumpster of every single fast-food joint and restaurant along the highway.
 
We have a small island on wheels in our breakfast area. In the cabinet are towels, treats, 30-foot leads, etc. On top is a very large tin that holds about 15 pounds of dog food, and some smaller tins with treats. We also keep glucosamine supplements here.
 
I am wondering if you know of any research regarding particular smells that can be used to calm an anxious dog. My dog has a very high sense of smell which I believe acts as a trigger leading to anxiety. Since you mention the right nostril specifically, I am curious if there is a scent and a way to place that scent close to the right nostril to act as a distraction from scents that may trigger anxious responses. Thank you.

Many dogs have gotten a bad reputation over the years for being "dangerous breeds." Rottweilers are among them. Like pit bulls and other large, blocky-headed types of dogs, these powerful and beautiful animals are often assumed to be aggressive.

Hosts are in charge of keeping their park areas clean, and many go out of their way to provide visitors with exceptional experiences. Because each host can control the number of guests that visit in a given time period, they're able to maintain their spaces better than many public parks departments can. It's a win-win for everyone in the community!

When I started to get out and about with Baby V, I occasionally experienced a strange phenomenon. Women would approach and coo some pleasant little noises. After an appropriate amount of time had passed, these strangers would lean in close and ask to smell my baby.
 
Scientists recently studied the brains of women as they sniffed new baby scent. Two-day-old babies delivered the good stuff by wearing the same pajamas for two nights. Women then sniffed the odor extracted from the outfit while brain scans assessed neural activity.

Brain imaging data show small everyday changes in brain activity in a single person (green and yellow colors). After a dose of psilocybin, activity changes dramatically as neural collectives fall out of sync (yellow, orange and red). After the drug wears off, activity returns to normal.

Something like wireshark (its free) is used by most people for this type of thing, however it will log EVERYTHING.. Packet sniffing is not user friendly, it can take a long time and practice to master this.
 
This ACLU of Illinois report begins with a brief discussion of the Study Act, upon which this report is based. It then presents findings of substantial and ongoing racial disparate impact in the use of consent searches and dog sniff searches during routine traffic stops.
 
The Study Act has twice been expanded to capture new kinds of traffic stop data. In 2006, in response to Study Act data regarding racial disparity in consent searches, it was expanded to require disclosure of whether a consent search yielded contraband, and whether a motorist declined consent to search. See Public Act 94-997. In 2011, in response to Study Act data regarding racial disparity in canine sniffs, it was expanded to document whether a dog sniff occurred, whether a dog alerted, whether a dog alert caused a search by an officer, and whether contraband was discovered. See Public Act 97-0469.[3]
 
Statewide in 2013, black and Hispanic motorists were nearly twice as likely as white motorists to have their vehicles consent searched during traffic stops. Specifically, black motorists were 95% more likely, and Hispanic motorists were 89% more likely. There are similar disparities every year such data has been collected starting in 2004. See Exh. 3 (analysis of statewide consent search rates).
 
Hispanic motorists were 2.49 times more likely than w
