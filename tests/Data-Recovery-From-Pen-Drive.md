When a user empties their trash, they delete any files or folders that were in it from Drive. Your Drive audit log shows the name of the user and when they emptied their trash. If an item is in the trash for more than 30 days, Drive automatically deletes it. In these cases, the Drive audit log shows Google System as the user who deleted the item. For details, go to Drive audit log.
 
You might be able to retrieve data older than 25 days if it was subject to retention rules or holds. A Vault user can search for retained data and export it. However, you can't directly restore this data to the user's Drive. For details, go to Get started with Vault search and export.
 
Since 1985, DriveSavers has recovered data from hard drives and other storage media that have crashed, mechanically failed, experienced physical damage, and worse. Call now to begin the data recovery process.
 
DriveSavers supports over 20,000 business partners worldwide. Your business could be one of them! Some of our satisfied customers include companies such as Coca Cola, Facebook, Google, AT&T, Sony, NASA, and many others. Learn more.
 
In the virtual world of the web, other data recovery companies may claim to provide the same levels of experience, service, and security as DriveSavers. But, can they really support what they say? DriveSavers provides proof. Learn more.

Since 1985, DriveSavers has recovered data from all digital storage media. We have successfully recovered data from over 200,000 devices with every type of data loss, including deletion, mechanically failed, burnt, wet, and crushed.
 
DriveSavers has the highest success rate in the industry. This is attributed to an in-house research and development (R&D) team, close relationships with device manufacturers, and over 37 years of experience.
 
All data recoveries are performed in accordance with standards set by leading hard drive, smartphone, and data storage manufacturers. All leading manufacturers authorize DriveSavers to open sealed device mechanisms; our data recovery process will not void your original warranty and allows you to receive an in-warranty device replacement from the manufacturer.
 
We only need the storage drive. You can bring in or ship the entire laptop or desktop if you prefer; however, we do not need the whole computer. You or an IT professional can remove the hard drive or solid-state drive from the system.
 
In most cases, we can restore the original folder structure of the device. The recovered data is transferred onto a new storage device and shipped back to you along with the original device via FedEx. Your package will include easy-to-follow instructions and links to support videos on how to review, use, and back up your recovered data.
 
In certain situations, DriveSavers provides unparalleled remote data recovery service for data loss situations that do not involve mechanical or physical damage. It may be a recovery option for RAID, NAS, and SAN systems, hardware too large to ship (i.e. large servers), and for highly sensitive data that needs to stay on-premises.
 
Before sending in the device to DriveSavers, we will ask what specific data is most important. If the data specified is unrecoverable, then there will be no charge and DriveSavers will ship the device back at no cost.
 
Payment is collected when the recovery is complete, before shipping or pickup. You do not need to provide payment to start the data recovery process. DriveSavers accepts all major credit cards. Purchase orders and NET terms can be provided for approved corporations and government institutions.
 
DriveSavers has the highest chance of success in the industry. Our in-house R&D team, combined with relationships with all leading storage device manufacturers, allows us the highest opportunity for success. DriveSavers handles every kind of data loss situation, and has helped hundreds of thousands of customers who have lost data. In fact, our engineers handle more devices in one day than the average data recovery center in one month. Our volume of recovered data speaks for itself.
 
Our mission is to successfully recover your data as safely and quickly as possible and to provide you with a stress-free experience. We offer worldwide service for a diverse range of customers, including Fortune 500 companies, small to medium-sized businesses, and home users.
 
Questions seeking **product, service, or learning material recommendations** are off-topic because they become outdated quickly and attract opinion-based answers. Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem you're trying to solve. Share your research. Here are a few suggestions on how to properly ask this type of question.
 
My computer has stopped working because the hard disk has broken. I used it to store important data without having a backup, and several files (.xslx, .word, .pdf) could not be recovered or they are corrupt when we use a program to access it. Is there any other way to try to recover them?
 
If your data has value, go to a pro. Most recoveries, even those requiring clean room work do not exceed say $850 but some labs are in to $300 - $500 range even if clean room is required and if no additional parts need to be sourced.
 
Many failed DIY attempts may hamper recovery and add to the price. This is true if the data loss has a physical cause and if in-place repairs are attempted (partition table editing, rebuild RAID etc.).
 
With sudden data loss a physical cause should not be ruled out before hand, even if the damage appears to be at the logical level. For example, a RAW file system can be due to logical corruption, it is however also a common symptom for physical damage. Even just repeated read attempts can further damage a drive or cause firmware damage (g-list overflow).
 
It does not hurt to use a S.M.A.R.T. utility. Although the information may be overwhelming it can be useful. Treat information as such: If the SMART tool alerts you about problems then assume there are in fact problems. However, absence of alerts does not mean the drive is okay by definition.
 
If raw values are non zero the drive had, at some point, problems reading sectors. Large values IMO (say > 20) are alarming even if the SMART tools says they are not. An easy to use and free SMART tool is CrystalDiskInfo. In menu Function > Advanced Feature > set RAW values to 10 [DEC]. Most of the file recovery tools I'll recommend later on also can display SMART data.
 
It is true that SSD's are less prone to mechanical damage of moving parts. Still, sudden disappearance of data can have physical causes such as sudden loss of power. SSD's can and do suddenly fail just like conventional hard drives.
 
Also SSD's can experience 'bad sectors' although these are of an entirely different nature than bad sectors on spinning disks. Such bad sectors can have cascading effects and SSD's, once they start behaving odd or unstable can deteriorate rapidly. A a lab is not an option and you need more than a few files, skip to cloning.
 
TRIM is often misunderstood. it's is important to understand that TRIM is a command that is sent by for example the operating system to inform the SSD drive about a range of sectors that can be discarded. TRIM is not file deletion of erasure in itself.
 
It depends on a specific OS if and when it sends TRIM commands. One OS may send a TRIM command immediately if for example a file is deleted, the other may schedule weekly TRIM commands, or an OS may do both.
 
For example Windows sends a TRIM command when you format a partition or as soon as you delete a file - if it concerns a NTFS formatted volume. So, in general data recovery from a formatted partition is impossible unless: 'circumstances' (non 'supported' file system, older USB bridge not relaying TRIM commands, etc.).
 
If you however you can not access the partition because the file system is RAW, this is no reason for Windows to 'TRIM' that partition and in general one can assume the data can be recovered. So in general, an OS will only TRIM data that is purposely deleted.
 
TRIM =/= erasure, or zero-fill although it may appear that way. In short: Many controllers 'unmap' trimmed LBA addresses. Try reading such LBA addresses and the controller simply returns zeros without even ever reading the drive. A data recovery lab may be able to recover 'trimmed' data while a data recovery lab can not recover data that was truly overwritten, even if only overwritten with zeros.
 
Can be used to make some in place repairs where it concerns MBR, partition tables and boot sectors. These are a tiny fraction of all things that can be wrong and prevent access to your data, and in general it's a bad idea to make in-place repairs. That said, for a knowledgeable person patching a disk can be the quickest way to recovery with only marginal risks.
 
Also reason for data loss plays a role: If the known cause is accidental partition deletion, and the layout of the disk is known, picking the correct partitions isn't rocket science and fairly low risk IMO. If on the other hand cause for the data loss is unknown it makes no sense to try TestDisk just for the sake of it.
 
Partition undelete/recovery only makes sense if partitions are not visible, not if new partitions were already created and formatted. Boot sector repair only makes sense if the issue is actually the boot sector.
 
Even though these tools are designed for this and good at what they do (specially HDDSuperClone), if cloning/imaging is problematic (drive disappears randomly, extremely slow, noisy) it's wise to stop DIY attempts.
