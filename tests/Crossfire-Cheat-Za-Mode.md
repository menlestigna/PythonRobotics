if I can reduce the number of hull/shield reps they use (only once instead of the 10 odd times they can rep)- I can feel this is will make the gameplay a lot easier.
There's a file called loadout.ini in the data/ships folder - but changing the values there from 10 to 1 for shields/armor reps on the rats doesn't change anything in game!!!
This is an example of the change I made (for one ship - I modified this for all the Rogues Ships for reducing the difficulty in the NewYork missions):

I was sure this would reduce the Rats to rep their shields/hull only ONCE hence killing them easier and reducing the overall difficulty of the SP missions. But this didn't seem to have any effect in game.
Can anyone help? (or suggest a mod that will do this for me?)
 
1st : welcome to the Portal !
2nd : Please post your topic only once in the correct thread (use the edit button to mark that your thread must be deleted by a moderator if you made a mistake)
3rd : CF DIfficulty is indeed harder than normal but its not impossible to make the storyline. I dont know how you could make it easier by modding the files but i suggest you take more time trading goods in Ny to equip your ship with better equip before responding to juni (you can take the time you want before going on a mission...) The difficulty will make you better trust me !

Instead of modding the game why dont you get online in multiplayer and profit of experienced players' help ? You'll find that its much better than flying in solo in SP ! And the CF story quests (finding Earth, Altair and the Inner Core) are in MP too !
 
I just might at that! Why would the creators feel at odds with adjusting difficulty of SP? Its not going to impact other players. In fact, I saw a post on the NET where some dude has managed to fix this with the mod. He uploaded it to a link thats long dead - so is he IMO.
So its not exactly mojo.
I would like to know what files to change to get this done etc just to be on top of things - any expert opinion would boost things.
 
There is a way to make things easier in SP without changing any files of the Mod.
Go to your C:\Users\%Username\Documents\My Games\Freelancer folder and open the PerfOptions.ini. Then change the value DIFFICULTY\_SCALE to something like 0.80 or less. 
This will reduce the damage you get from NPCs shooting at your ship, so the time you need to kill your enemies will probably not decrease. This will only help if you're having trouble to survive engagements.
 
**Be sure you reset this setting when playing online** - i don't know if this will affect Multiplayer too, but i wouldn't risk being banned for cheating or tempering with the Mod. IIRC OP has some anti-cheat-detection in his mod...
 
Leaving the difficulty setting at a low setting will not affect multiplayer experience. All information on settings comes from OP's server so anything you do to that file will not change multiplayer. Even if (god-forbid) you modded CF for your own needs, which I wouldn't recommend because CF's awesome enough as is and you could really screw yourself over if you tried, you would still get most information from the server in MP so things would be by OP's standards, not your own.
 
Thanks - this is useful. I have NO intentions of hacking MP - Because I don't like MP (Don't kill me for this) 
I'm playing CF exclusively for the SP campaign - I just don't like spending half hour per mission killing rats to do it. I don't mind the occasional shield/hull rep by the NPCs to add a little challenge - but 10 times is a bit too much for me!!
 
While the quoted suggestion will help a lot - I'd STILL like someway to reduce the number of shield/hull reps NPC rats can do, as I tried in my original post - with intentionally making it explicit to the Admin / OP I have no intention of using this in MP!!! So Please - help me out guys!! (Whine)
 
sixsigma1978 if you make changes to the mod files (even if it is SP) you are in violation of the Liscence agreement! which OP brought up earlier in this post.. i would suggest that you dont change anything.. you can get into serious trouble for doing such things without permission!!!

 
sixsigma1978 , I DON'T suggest you do anything , you can beat them up by the fair way. Everybody from here does that, and we all will continiue that way. It takes more time until you gain more experience before you can beat them up.
 
i guess your not listening to OP when he says to re-read the liscnece agreement!! which you are trying to violate!!! doesnt matter if it is SP or not... you NEED permission to make changes to the mod because it is NOT yours to change!
 
You dont understand? Let me simplify this for you man,How the heck would you feel if you spent Years on something ,Just to have someone nitpick something so simple as nanos and bats that npc's use.This mod is a masterpiece,you would be surpirsed how good the community really is for crossfire.people are willing to help,If your willing to listen.Otherwise have fun with your lawyer:Dhope its a good one
 
Yeah I should've been more specific in that question. What I meant was, when will I start to see the crossfire unique weapons/items? So far on manhattan and pittsburgh it's all the same weapons/ships as vanilla. Crossfire adds a lot of new gear, does it not?
 
Yeah I use regedit fairly often. I was going to ask you if you thought it was a good idea to rename the freelancer folder after each mod that I activated for it, but then I realized that the mod would remain activated in FLMM. Having tried to deactivate a mod after putting my vanilla folders back got me into trouble once already so I figured I'd scratch the idea. Your regedit idea will fix that. This, it seems to me, makes for the best solution. Full proof. I'll rename my folder "Freelancer - crossfire", and then put "Freelancer" (vanilla) back, do the registry trick, and I can try other mods without worrying about crossfire. That sound about right?
 
Oh, on your suggestion I downloaded discovery 4.80 (I don't play MP). It doesn't, however, have the flmm extension, it's rather just a collection of folders and files. I think you warned me about this once already, but how do I implement these mods? Install the folders over vanilla?
 
Lastly, on the fight/flight thing, it's not a question of knowing when to run or fight. I realize I should run when I'm getting my ass kicked, along with the factors you mentioned. My query is more about the situations where I don't have the luxury of running. My ship is absolutely worthless at the moment and I'm getting creamed, but I can't run or the guy we have to protect will get killed and I have to go back to last save. But the enemy ships are tearing through me with ease and I can't tell if it's because I'm being too aggressive...let me ask it like this. Do you ever find yourself needing to fire up cruise and get away from the enemy until your shields return, and then go back to continue combat and repeating this cycle as necessary? I never had to do that in my vanilla playthrough, I'm just wondering if that's going to become necessary with crossfire.
 
Unless I have my mods confused, one of the best Crossfire-specific ships is available immediately, right from New York, before Juni unlocks the gates to the rest of Liberty. If you want me to tell you where it is then we should do it in a clearly marked "spoiler" thread, ok?
 
Worthless ship... so you're still in the Starflier that Juni gave you? That is perhaps the most vulnerable time of the game because you have weak shields, thin armor, and she gives you those wimpy Liberty lasers to start. Yes, about the only thing you CAN do in the Starflier is run away. Oh, but then your buddy, King, drags you into a couple of knife fights against superior numbers of well-armed and well-trained enemies... yeah, you're pretty much toast (\*heavy sigh\*).
 
[\*:355y883p]Cruise engines are great for escaping from pirates, but they have two problems in battle. First, they take five seconds to warm up. Your thrusters don't work during those five long seconds, so you cannot even slide or run... you are a sitting duck. Second, if you flee too far from the center of combat during a mission, then Mission Command (the "Big Brother" people who pay you) will fail the mission on you.
