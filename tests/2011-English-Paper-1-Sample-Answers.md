We recommend managing your time wisely, as you will not be given extra time at the end of the sub-test to check your answers. The test is designed so that the time available is enough for you to read, choose your answers, and check your work.
 
Please remember that there is a strict time limit for Part A (the expeditious reading task), and Part A materials will be collected from you after 15 minutes. You will therefore not have any time to check your Part A answers later in the test.
 
Yes, you must use correct spelling in the Reading sub-test to get the marks. Responses that are not spelled correctly will not receive any marks. American and British English spelling variations are accepted, e.g., foetus and fetus are both acceptable. Please note that the Reading sub-test is different from the Listening sub-test in the way misspellings are treated.
 
Test-takers awarded grade B (a scale score of 350) will typically have a score of at least 30 marks. It is important to note that new reading tests are written for each test session incorporating new material. This means that the grade boundaries are adjusted slightly for each test to allow for minor differences in the difficulty of items included in that particular version. The number of marks needed to secure grade B will therefore vary.

SQE2 is the second part of the SQE assessment and tests both practical legal skills and functioning legal knowledge. You will take 16 assessments in SQE2: 12 written assessments and four oral assessments. There is not a pass mark for each individual station in SQE2, but an overall pass mark for the assessment, which is set at the standard of a competent newly qualified solicitor.
 
You should note that professional conduct and ethics are core parts of SQE2 and that questions on ethics will be pervasive throughout the SQE2 assessment. Ethical issues will not be flagged. You will need to identify any ethical and professional conduct issues and exercise judgement to resolve them honestly and with integrity.
 
We provide a range of sample questions to help you prepare for SQE2. The sample questions will also help education providers plan SQE2 training. These questions will help you understand the content and format of the SQE2 assessment, as well as giving an idea of its level and breadth. They give an indication of the type of tasks that could be set but do not represent every task that might be covered in the SQE2 assessments. They are not an indication that all SQE2 assessments will follow a precise style in either format or content. Future questions may vary in both format and content.
 
Each of the sample questions includes a sample candidate answer and a discussion of the answer, with guidance on the key legal points and a short analysis of the performance of the sample candidate by reference to the criteria for the assessment. The sample advocacy answer includes a short video recording of a sample candidate performance. The other sample answers contain only written guidance. The sample answers are designed to give you some insight into the style of assessment you will see on the day.
 
We also provide a set of Performance Indicators for each assessment. The purpose of the Performance Indicators, which are also used by the assessors and markers, is to give you some examples of the types of behaviour that demonstrate competence or that suggest that a candidate is not competent in relation to each of the SQE2 law and skills assessment criteria. You can access the full set of Performance Indicators below in both English and Welsh:
 
The links below go to a summary of each question and answer, along with a PDF of the complete question, additional papers, sample candidate answer and discussion of the answer. Please note, the samples are available in both English and Welsh.
 
Please note that the copy and paste function for the SEQ2 written assessments is slightly different to the functionality in the PearsonVue test platform example in the link below. For a full explanation of how the copy and paste function works in the assessments, please see the SQE2 written assessments copy and paste functionality which explains with the use of screenshots and text how you can copy and paste from the question and PDF documents.
 
There is no spell check or highlighting function for the SQE2 written assessment. The assessment criteria for the SQE2 written assessments refer to clear, precise, concise and acceptable language rather than correct spelling. Guidance on this is provided in the SQE2 assessment specification. Minor spelling mistakes are not penalised and the focus is on the assessment criteria mentioned and how spelling mistakes impact that. Performance in each of the assessment criteria is assessed by trained assessors making professional judgments related to the required standard for the assessment.
 
**Please note, however, that if you are viewing the SQE2 sample question on your own computer or device, your own browser may add tools such as predictive text or a spell check. The assessments are undertaken on the Pearson VUE assessment platform which is a closed platform and does not permit browsers or access to the internet. This means that it is unlikely to have the same functions as those allowed by your own browser.**
 
Various State Bar Examiners release essay and performance test questions used on prior exams. Some states release sample answers to these exam questions. Review the past questions and answers as a part of your bar exam preparation. Links to released questions for available states are listed below:
 
The ISEE Essay is the fifth and final section of the ISEE lower, middle, and upper level tests. This personal essay is not scored; however, a copy of it is sent to each school to which families send their scores. Students have 30-minutes in which to write up to 2 pages in response to one prompt.
 
The prompt is asking you about something that you have done that has had an effect on your life in some way. After completing this task, you could be a completely different person, or you are more firmly set on the path towards your goals.
 
Something that I have accomplished that has made a great impact on me is the vacation I took to England last year, the first time I traveled outside of the country. In English class, we had just learned about Shakespeare and read parts of some plays, and in History class we had been studying Stonehenge and other ruins. My parents thought the trip would be a great connection to my studies. Upon visiting Stratford-upon-Avon, Stonehenge, and museums in London, my interest in the wider world grew immensely.
 
For the rest of our trip, we visited many museums around London. In the British Museum, I was most interested in the Rosetta Stone, the large stone tablet that allowed us to decipher several ancient languages. The stone was much larger than I anticipated, and I could clearly see the various markings covering it. I suddenly imagined scientists discovering it and marveling at the opportunities it presented to understanding ancient languages.
 
The prompt is asking you about the most important individual that you have modeled yourself and/or the things you do in some way and their influence on you. This individual does not need to be someone you have actually met, nor does his or her influence have to have had that great of an impact on you.
 
However, role models are usually those individuals who have changed or shaped your life in an effective way. Your choice does not necessarily have to be heavy or serious, but you think carefully about your choice. For example, your role model can be a/an:
 
My most important role model as a child was Batman. I have always admired his actions, and growing up, many of my birthday parties were Batman-themed, and I was always Batman for Halloween. Batman is a great role model as he always tries to do the right thing as a person and as a crime-fighter, he is charitable to those in need, and he has persevered through a very difficult life.
 
Batman has led a very difficult life, but he has made the most of it. When he lost his family at a young age, he found a father figure in the family butler, Alfred. Batman always selflessly seeks to help those in need. Whenever I feel down about how life is treating me, I think of all the hardships that Batman has faced and try to make the most of the situation, because there are many people who have it worse than I do.
 
All in all, Batman was, and still is, the most important role model to me as a child. He inspires me to stop violence and wrongdoing whenever I can, strive to help as many people as possible, and to overcome hardships with optimistic thinking. Although he is fictional, Batman demonstrates what it really means to be a good person.
 
The prompt is asking you about an eventful school trip that you would like to go to with your friends. This could be a place that would be educational, sports related, or anything that just interests you.
 
If I were in charge of a school trip, I would take my fellow classmates to a place that is not only full of excitement and fun, but also must be educational. That is why I would take my class to the NASA Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA would be the best possible trip because it is a historic place for the United States and highly educational. It is urgent to go soon, though, before there are even more budget cuts.
 
The Space Center holds some of the most indispensable memories from our past. The history of NASA can show us how the race to the moon inspired the advan
