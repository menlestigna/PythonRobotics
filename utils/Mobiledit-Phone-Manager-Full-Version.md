One of the aspects that sets MOBILedit Phone Manager apart from the competition is its great compatibility with all types of devices. The first version of this software dates back to 1996, so the program is compatible with virtually any smartphone released after that date. This means that you can sync your Android devices (whatever version they may be), iPhones, Blackberrys, Windows Phones, Symbian phones, and tons of other devices from the early 2000s. This program is compatible with virtually any device.
 
One of the most common ways to use MOBILedit Phone Manager is to transfer information from an old device to a new one. This program has a special tool dedicated to transferring information between devices. All you have to do is indicate what you want to transfer between the two devices, and, in a matter of minutes, your new device will have the contacts, photos, documents, text messages, and other data imported from the old one.
 
Apart from this tool, MOBILedit Phone Manager also lets you perform almost any action you can perform directly on your smartphone. For example, you can send an SMS using your PC keyboard or edit a ringtone directly from the app itself. You can also easily transfer photos and videos from your PC to your smartphone and vice versa. There's practically nothing this software can't do.

Download MOBILedit Phone Manager to start managing your smartphone from your PC. Whether you have an older Android or the latest iPhone, you can access your contacts, photos, text messages, and everything else.
 
Uptodown is a multi-platform app store specialized in Android. Our goal is to provide free and open access to a large catalog of apps without restrictions, while providing a legal distribution platform accessible from any browser, and also through its official native app.
 
Most Android devices should be able to be rooted. However, the process of rooting is specific to each phone model, version of Android, and build number, so you always need to find the right tool according to your phone model.
 
You can root a majority of modern Android phones using an app called KingoRoot, if for some reason this method doesn't work for you (locked bootloader, Knox, etc.), you may be able to find help on how to root your phone at XDA Developers, which is a website with a large active user community dedicated entirely to Android smartphones.
 
Please note that sometimes it is necessary to unlock your phone's bootloader in order to root it. You can find a step-by-step tutorial on how to unlock the bootloader on your phone manufacturer's webpage.
 
Rooting your phone may void the manufacturer's warranty and could cause security risks. Please take this into consideration before performing this process.Rooting a Samsung device will trip the Knox Warranty void flag which will make the data stored in Knox permanently inaccessible.
 
**Tethered**- This method requires you to connect your iPhone to your computer and use an external application to jailbreak it. Once you restart your iPhone, the jailbreak is undone, but please note: your device will not be usable until you jailbreak it again using the same method.
 
**Semi-tethered**- This method doesn't require you to connect your iPhone to a computer in order to jailbreak it, however, the jailbreak is still undone every time you reboot your device, or, after a certain amount of time passes.
 
**Untethered**- This method doesn't necessarily require a computer to perform a jailbreak on your device and also modifies the iOS on a deeper level which means that no matter how many times you reboot your device, it stays jailbroken until you manually "un-jailbreak" it.
 
There are specific known ways to jailbreak almost every iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch running on almost every iOS, except the latest releases - as it usually takes a few months to find a way of jailbreaking the newest version of iOS.
 
Currently, the most often used apps for jailbreaking iOS devices are Pangu or Cydia Impactor. You can learn more about how Cydia works on the app developer's official website here, or you can read this article which describes a simplified process of iOS jailbreaking.
 
There are many ways how to create a physical image from a device. You can, of course, use some tools of your own and use our software for extraction but our product MOBILedit Forensic does offer some tools as well:
 
This exploit method does not work on all MTK-equipped devices, but sometimes it is the only way of acquiring the physical image because the phone does not have to be booted up or unlocked in order to perform this operation; which means you can try even if the phone is off or locked.
 
There is also a way of extracting physical images from phones with Qualcomm chipsets without root access (rooting the phone). This exploit method does not work on all Qualcomm-equipped devices and it is best when used with an EDL cable.More information about how to use EDL method in MOBILedit Forensic can be found here.
 
The "LAF bypassing" feature works on all LG smartphones with the new version of LG LAF protocol (this is a service download mode similar to Samsung Odin download mode). One of the first devices to feature this version was the first LG G flagship.
 
TWRP even comes with a built-in file manager with unlimited root access so you can modify, add or delete any system files manually. This process allows you to gain a physical image, therefore bypassing the otherwise locked devices protection.
 
With the advances in iOS security, it is becoming commonplace that you need to know the PIN code to extract data successfully from iOS devices. The Lockdown method can bypass the screen lock with some iOS versions if the PIN code is unknown.
 
For successful extraction from iPhone is required to know the iTunes backup password. Without the iTunes backup password, the final result will not show much data, such as data from WhatsApp, Contacts, Photos, etc.
 
If you are not able to obtain the iTunes backup password and don't need to analyze data from the old iTunes backup, with iOS 11 or later, you can make a new encrypted backup of your device by resetting the password.
 
Follow the steps to reset your settings. This won't affect your user data or passwords, but it will reset settings like display brightness, Home Screen layout, and wallpaper. It also removes your encrypted backup password.
 
It is not always necessary for the iTunes Windows application to be installed to use MOBILedit, which is usually required by other mobile forensic solutions. MOBILedit can communicate directly with iPhones or iPads using our direct Apple device driver, which can be downloaded from our website. But please remember, iTunes needs to be installed if you wish to communicate with an Apple Watch or a jailbroken iOS or iPadOS device.
 
Do not turn off the Apple Mobile Device Service while the iOS device is connected to MOBILedit Forensic. If the service is stopped it will disconnect the device and communication with MOBILedit Forensic. MOBILedit Forensic will repeatedly try to regain communication yet will be unable to.
 
If the iPhone is jailbroken, MOBILedit can extract all files, including application sandboxes or system files. To achieve this, MOBILedit needs iTunes installed, so please follow the above instructions. You can jailbreak iPhones using the USB drive in the MOBILedit Connection Kit. It is a small Linux live distribution that contains the Bootra1n software used to deploy Checkra1n.
 
Even with jailbreak, device encryption is still working, e.g., if the device was not unlocked after reboot, a limited set of data is available for extraction. Also, some applications protect files, when the phone is locked, so for full filesystem extraction, you still need to unlock the phone.
