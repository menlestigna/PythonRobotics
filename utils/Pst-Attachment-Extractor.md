To ensure that email attachments are only extracted from certain emails, numerous properties of an email can be used as a filter criterion. All criteria can be combined. Only if all filter criteria are met, the attachment of the relevant email is saved. For example, with Outlook Attachment Extractor, you can create a specific rule for storing email attachments to process only emails containing a specific term in the subject and a PDF file as attachment.
 
If required, the location where the attachments extracted from the emails are saved can be put together dynamically of properties of the emails. For example, the receipt date of the email or the name of the sender can be used as a subfolder. Furthermore, a part of the attachment file name can be used for the folder or file name of the attachment to be saved.
 
The program is aimed at users who receive frequently or at regular intervals emails with Outlook containing an attachment that should be archived or processed automatically. This can be, for example, the monthly bill or a zip file, which should be stored in a specific directory and is handed over to a specified program as parameter for further processing. Especially on a large number of incoming emails, a manual inspection and sorting of the emails can take a long time to complete and binds a lot of work performance. Outlook Attachment Extractor can perform these tasks after a single set up automatically in the background, saving you time.
 
The software is easy to configure and offers through the support of multiple profiles the possibility of adding flexible filter rules to apply them individually to an email account. Since you can also apply multiple profiles to an email account, the attachments from emails can be stored, for example, depending on the sender or subject in an individual directory. Thus, attachments of certain email types can be stored in directories which are automatically created from the receipt date or from a part of the file name of the attachment. For other email types, for example, the sender's name could be used as a storage folder for the email attachment.

I found the Attachment Extractor that should do exactly what I want--to delete attachments from selected or all emails. Unfortunately, after installing it and restarting Thunderbird, it did not work for me. I selected a group of messages, some with attachments, and picked "Extract from selected messages" on the context menu. Nothing happens; no JavaScript errors. I have tried for a single email message, and for an entire mail folder with the same results. My AE settings include "delete attachment with normal Thunderbird code" and "notify me when all have been extracted". No other check boxes are enabled on the "after extraction" tab.
 
I came back a day later with fresh eyes. I assumed the add-on worked and that I was missing something. My only goal was to delete attachments. But I thought perhaps it really wanted to save attachments as well. I found two settings to try: giving a default path to save attachments to (general tab >> default save path) and more signficantly disabling the saving of attachments (advanced tab >> attachment file saving >> disable saving). Setting the former made the add-on start working, doing a detach-and-save, while setting the latter then did a detach-only. Problem solved!
 
For future reference as well, if you are trying to save attachments automatically, Attachment Extractor does not like it when multiple emails come in at the same time with attachments... the add-on gets confused and only extracts one of the attachments.
