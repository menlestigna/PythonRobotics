You can only use Valspar 4000 Zero VOC Interior Latex indoors, but you can use Valspar 4000 Alkyd Enamel indoors and outdoors. Alkyd Enamel has a durable glossy finish, ideal for wood, metal, drywall, cabinets, trim, and other surfaces.
 
This chart details the volume solids percentage of Valspar 2000 paint and both Valspar 4000 options, organized by finish. As you can see, Valspar 2000 has higher volume solids than 4000, so you can expect slightly better coverage and protection.
 
Professional painters often use contractor-grade paints because they are cheaper. And since pro painters know the proper application techniques, they can work with lower-grade paints and make them look as good as more expensive paints.
 
The FLEXiO 4000 stationary paint sprayer is perfect for longer painting projects, with less weight in your hand, because the motor is housed in the base on the ground. It has variable speeds for cutting time and effort on painting projects and can paint a wall 12 times faster than a brush.

It has the flexibility to spray indoors and outdoors with the power to spray unthinned paint and stains with full coverage. Cleaning is faster than a brush or roller with just a few removable parts that separate and rinse clean.
