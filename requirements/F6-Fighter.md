In response, the Indian Air Force, along with RAW agent Zareena Begum, plan a counterattack on Akhtar's base in Balakot. Despite succeeding in the mission, the aftermath causes conflict between India and Pakistan. The Pakistan Air Force launches a retaliatory attack on the Indian base as a result. Despite Rocky's orders, Patty, Taj, and Bash cross the Indo-Pakistan border. Taj's and Bash's planes are shot down by Pakistani pilots, leading to them getting captured. Patty is removed from the team of Air Dragons by Rocky following a court of Inquiry. He is posted as a flying instructor at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad. It is revealed to Minni by Rocky that he holds a grudge against Patty for letting his fiance, Naina Jai Singh (revealed to be Rocky's younger sister), die in a previous rescue mission.
 
The Pakistani government announces that they will be escorting Taj and Bash safely back to India. However, the Air Dragons team gets a shock as the chopper, which had gone to receive Taj and Bash, returns only with Bash's dead body. Sukhi tells Patty that Bash was brutally murdered by Akhtar and has imprisoned a badly injured Taj. Determined to rescue him, Patty defies orders and joins a covert mission. The team successfully infiltrates the enemy territory and Patty is able to rescue Taj and kill Akhtar. In the post-credit scene, Minni and Patty embrace, celebrating their victory.
 
Siddharth Anand narrated the idea of making a big-budget action thriller against the backdrop of fighter jets while shooting the film *War* (2019). Hrithik Roshan loved the basic premise of the story. During COVID-19 lockdown in India, Anand worked on developing the story further and narrated it to Roshan, who later confirmed for the film. In December 2020, it was reported that Siddharth Anand and Hrithik Roshan are going to reunite for a film after *War* (2019).[15]
 
Ramon Chibb, filmmaker and writer, wrote the story along with Siddharth Anand.[24] Later, Chibb wrote the screenplay of the film under the supervision of Anand and Hrithik Roshan.[25] Akshay Oberoi said that the film has "much heavier" action scenes than *Pathaan* (2023).[26] Anand further retained most of his norm technicians including cinematographer Satchith Paulose, editor Aarif Sheikh, stunt choreographer SeYeong Oh, and action director Sunil Rodrigues.[27][28] Raj Khatri designed posters of the film.[29]
 
In September 2022, Roshan started taking workshops and had continued 12-week simulator training and learned the nuances of playing a fighter jet pilot.[30] His training was supervised by Kris Gethin, developing his abdominal muscles and losing weight.[31] In November 2022, he visited the IAF air base in Tezpur, Assam.

Real-life Indian Air Force personnel including officers and flight cadets have worked on the film.

The pullup is the logical choice of exercise to strengthen your lats. If you ask an experienced bodybuilder how to work the latissimus most thoroughly, he will tell you to look up, force your chest open, and draw your shoulder blades together at the top of the pullup. This may be okay for bodybuilders, but what does this have to do with fighting?
 
The system is intended to be used for four weeks. At the end of the month, take two or three days off and then test yourself. It is not unusual to up the reps 2.5-3 times. In other words, you are likely to end up cranking out 12-15 reps if you started with 5. If you can already do between 6 and 12 reps, then start the program with the first day your PR shows up. For instance, if your max is 6 pullups start with day 7; if your max is 8 start with day 19.
 
Here is how the program applies to those who currently max at three pullups. The below is also excellent for anyone whose goal is pure strength rather than reps; just hang a kettlebell or a barbell plate on your waist to bring the reps down to three.
 
You can see that the higher the RM, the quicker the reps drop off. The reason is simple. You should have no problem doing four reps a few minutes after 5RMx5. But x24 is not going to happen after an all-out set of 25. The higher the reps, the greater the fatigue. Therefore, you need to start more reps down from your rep-max and cut the reps more between sets. Experiment. An extra day of rest here and there is also in order; the recovery from sets of fifteen or twenty is not nearly as quick as from fives and triples.
 
I max out at 20 pull-ups. What exactly would the programming be for this? I have an idea how to obviously (split the difference between 15 and 25) but if someone knows the exact programming that would be awesome. Thanks!
 
As this program is not meant to overwork the muscles, as long as possible. Too short a rest, an
